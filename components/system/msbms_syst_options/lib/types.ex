  Instance classes are used to identify certain sorts of workloads or
  operational parameters of application instances.

  The valid types of Instance Class are:

    * `primary`- general purpose instance class which includes instances
    designated as 'production'.  In most cases, this is the only instance
    class that is required.

    * `linked`- designates a class of instances which are the children of a
    parent instance.  Typically these are non-production instances which are
    copies of their parent instance.

    * `demo`- instances which support application demonstration purposes.  Most
    installations will not require this type to be used.

    * `reserved`- other special use instances which don't fall under the other
    categories.  Typically there is no need to use this class.
