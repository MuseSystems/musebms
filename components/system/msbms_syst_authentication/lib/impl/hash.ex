  # Note that this module exists mostly to wrap library APIs which provide
  # proper cryptographic functions.  We wrap things here so that we can have
  # some flexibility in which libraries to expose to the rest of the
  # application. For example, the currently favored Argon2 password hashing
  # algorithm provided by comeonin is documented as being difficult to build on
  # Windows; so for Windows builds we may need to use a different algorithm
  # here.
