  API for the management of user authentication.

  This Component provides a global method of authentication for users wishing to
  use the system.  General features supported by this Component include:

    * The ability to host user accounts that are managed by specific tenants

    * The ability to host user accounts that are independent of any specific
    tenant (e.g. freelance bookkeepers)

    * Authentication rights for users to specific Application Instances

    * Use of a single user account to authenticate to Application Instances
    owned by different tenants.

    * Individual tenant controls over certain authentication controls such as
    Password Credential complexity or requiring Multi-Factor Authentication

    * The ability to establish "Network Rules" which act as a sort of firewall
    allowing or denying certain origin host IP addresses or networks the right
    to attempt authentication

    * Rate limiting of authentication attempts enforced, independently, by
    identifier and by originating host IP address

  Note that this Component doesn't provide a substantial authorization
  capability.  Authorization needs are left for higher level, Application
  Instance functionality to fulfill.

  ## Concepts

  Below are listed the conceptual ideas that need to be understood to use this
  component effectively.  Concepts in this Component depend heavily on a number
  of concepts derived from the `MsbmsSystInstanceMgr` Component so familiarity
  with that Component will be helpful in understanding the ideas and functioning
  of this authentication component.

  #### Access Accounts

  An Access Account is the record type which defines a user of the system for
  the purposes of authentication.  Ideally, a single Access Account is defined
  for any single person in the world that will use the system.  The information
  that an Access Account captures about a user is limited to only that essential
  to the authentication process; this Component does not provide general
  information management for the user as a person.

  Access Accounts may be Owned Access Accounts or Unowned Access Accounts.
  Owned Access Accounts are the more common kind of account and they are
  directly managed by tenants (Owners).  Owned Access Accounts are the kinds of
  accounts which are created by an employer to provide their employees access to
  the system. Unowned Access Accounts are created directly by a user of the
  system and exist independent of any Owner.  Unowned Access Accounts facilitate
  independent contractors or freelancers which may need access a variety of
  Application Instances owned by different Owners.

  #### Identities

  An Identity is the means by which we can identify a specific Access Account
  using an identifier known to the Access Account holder.  There are different
  identifiers and methods of identification depending on the specific
  authentication use case being supported.

  Identifiers are unique to the Owner/Access Account combination.  All Unowned
  Access Accounts are considered as an Owner group for this purpose.  This means
  that the Owner of an Access Account must be known at authentication time since
  an identifier may be duplicated between different Owners.

  The supported basic Identity Types used for regular authentication are:

    * __Email__ - a typical interactive identification method where a user
    provides an email address as the means of identification.  An Access Account
    may define multiple Email Identities; for example, this can happen when a
    user changes email addresses and the old email address must remain valid
    prior to the new email address being validated by the Access Account holder.
    Email Identities may require validation by the Access Account holder prior
    to the email address being usable for identification purposes.  Unowned
    Access Accounts typically require validation and Owned Access Accounts
    typically will not.  All valid Email Identities use a common Password
    Credential for authenticating the identification.

    * __API Token__ - provides an identification mechanism for other programs to
    access the system on behalf of the Access Account holder.  An Access Account
    holder may define an arbitrary number of API Token Identities and typically
    should have one API Token Identity for each different program that will
    access the system.  API Token Identities require that a specific API Token
    Credential be provided at authentication time.  API Token Identity
    identifiers are usually randomly generated strings of characters.

  In addition to the basic Identity Types, there are a number of special purpose
  Identity Types:

    * __Account Code__ - provides a simple to use identifier which can be
    provided to third party Owners by an Access Account holder.  The use case
    here is an Access Account holder wants to access an Application Instance
    owned by a different organization than that to which the Access Account
    holder belongs.  The third party Owner must invite the Access Account holder
    to their instance and they issue the invitation to the Access Account
    identified by the provided Account Code.  This allows third party
    identification with necessarily disclosing information such as email
    addresses.  Note that there is no authentication process and no Credential
    for this Identity Type; this Identity Type exists purely for Access Account
    identification.

    * __Validation Token__ - a single use identifier which is created for the
    purpose of validating an Email Identity.  Only one Validation Token may
    exist for any one Email Identity at a time and the Email Identity may not
    already be validated.  The Validation Token Identity also requires a
    specific Validation Token Credential be provided at authentication time.
    Once a Validation Token Identity is successfully authenticated the
    associated Email Identity is immediately usable and the Validation Token
    Identity/Credential pair is deleted from the system.  Validation Token
    Identities are typically created with an expiration timestamp after which
    the Validation Token Identity may no longer be used.

    * __Recovery Token__ - a single use identifier which is created for the
    purpose of initiating Password Credential recovery.  Only a single Recovery
    Token Identity may exist for any Access Account at a time and that Access
    Account must have an existing Password Credential record which can be
    recovered.  The Recovery Token Identity must be authenticated with a
    specific Recovery Token Credential.  On successful authentication of a
    Recovery Token Identity, the Recovery Token Identity/Credential pair is
    immediately deleted from the system.  Recovery Token Identities are
    typically created with an expiration timestamp after which it may not longer
    be used.  Finally note that the existence of a Recovery Token in no way
    prevents the Password Credential from being used in authentication; it is
    expected if a recovery process is started accidentally or in attempt at a
    malicious recovery of the Password Credential, that the Recovery Identity/
    Credential will simply be ignored by the Access Account holder and allowed
    to expire.

  #### Credentials

  Credentials provide the means for an Access Account holder to prove that they
  have correctly identified themselves: that they are who they say they are.
  Credentials are the secrets which only the Access Account holder should know
  or have the ability to use.

  There are a variety of different Credential Types which are typically
  associated with a corresponding Identity Type:

    * __Password__ - defines a password for Access Account holders to use during
    interactive authentication attempts.  Typically Password Credentials are
    used in association with Email Identities.  Only a single Password
    Credential may exist for any single Access Account at a time.  Password
    Credentials are subject to Password Rules which are described later.
    Passwords are stored in the system using salted hashes and are not directly
    recoverable; forgotten passwords must be reset through a recovery process.

    * __API Token__ - used to authenticate API Token Identities.  Each API Token
    Credential is associated with a specific API Token Identity and may only
    authenticate that Identity.  API Token Credentials are usually a system
    generated string of random characters.  API Token Credentials are stored in
    the system using salted hashes.  At Credential create time, the creating
    process is provided with the plaintext credential so that it may be
    communicated to the Access Account holder, but is thereafter unrecoverable.

    * __Validation Token__ - behaves in most ways the same as the API Token
    Credential.  They key differences are that each Validation Token Credential
    is associated with a specific Validation Token Identity and that
    authentication using the Credential is a one time event; after a successful
    authentication the Validation Token is deleted from the system.

    * __Recovery Token__ - has all of the same behavioral characteristics of the
    Validation Token Credential except its context of usage is in Password
    Credential Recovery.

  >#### Note {: .neutral}

  > When looking at Credential related code, initialization data, tests, and
  > even in other documentation, you will find references to Multi-Factor
  > Authentication (MFA) functionality.  There are plans to include MFA
  > functionality and some work towards this goal, but that work is currently
  > incomplete and deferred until much more of the product is built out.

  #### Authenticators

  An Authenticator is simply the combination of related Identities and
  Credentials.  So, for example, an Access Account holder presenting an
  Email/Password combination for authentication is presenting an Email/Password
  Authenticator.  The concept isn't terribly important to this Component, but
  the term does appear elsewhere in the documentation and so deserves definition.

  #### Access Account/Instance Associations

  While most authorization activities are outside of the scope of this
  Component, one authorization exists that must be granted to an Access Account
  prior to its being able to successfully authenticate.   All authentications
  are performed in the context of authenticating for access to a specific
  Application Instance.  Owners of that Instance must authorize an Access
  Account to authenticate to their Instance prior to the authentication process
  succeeding (see `MsbmsSystInstancemgr` for more on Owners and Instances).

  Owned Access Accounts are typically granted access to all or specific
  Instances of the Owner which owns the Access Account.  Unowned Access Accounts
  are typically invited by an Owner to access a specific Instance and the
  Unowned Access Account holder must first accept the invitation to access the
  Instance prior to using it; the Access Account holder may also explicitly
  decline such an invitation if they so choose.

  Both the invitations to access and the permission to access an Instance are
  known as Access Account/Instance Associations.  The various attributes of the
  Association record determine if an invitation is outstanding, declined, or if
  access has been granted.

  #### Network Rules

  Network Rules are a simple whitelist/blacklist mechanism which evaluates the
  apparent origin IP address of an inbound authentication attempt and determines
  if that host is allowed to attempt an authentication. Network Rules may be
  defined established at the Global level (applicable to all Owners and
  Instances), the Owner level, or the Application Instance level.  Each Rule
  can be designated to apply to a single host, an IP network, or a simple range
  of IP addresses.  When a host is seen for which no Network Rule has been
  defined, a system default rule is applied which implicitly allows the
  authentication attempt.

  A special type of Network Rule called a Disallowed Host also exists.  A
  Disallowed Host is exactly as it sounds: a specific originating IP address
  which is not allowed to authenticate users to the system.  Disallowed Hosts
  are checked on a Global basis and the purpose of the list is to stop hosts
  determined to be behaving suspiciously from attempting authentications.
  Suspicious behavior is determined using a set of (currently naive) heuristics
  which are only evaluated for hosts attempting authentications under the system
  default implied Network Rule.

  #### Password Rules

  Password Rules define the standards that constitute acceptable passwords for
  use as Credentials during interactive authentication processes.  A Global
  Password Rule exists which sets the minimum requirements that all passwords in
  the system must meet before being accept for use.  Owners may each establish
  Owner Password Rules which govern the Access Accounts that they own.  Owner
  Password Rules may not reduce the stringency demanded of the Global Password
  Rules, they can only increase the required stringency for their owned Access
  Accounts.  If an Owner defined Password Rule does define a less stringent
  standard than demanded by the Global Password Rules, the Global Password Rule
  continue to be the one applied.  This evaluation is made rule by rule such
  that the effective Password Rules that an Access Account holder sees may be a
  mix of the more stringent combination of both the Owner and Global Password
  Rules.

  >#### Note {: .neutral}
  >
  > The term "stringency", or "weakening" which appears elsewhere in some
  > documentation, must not be understood to necessarily mean a strengthening or
  > weakening in security.  For example, an Owner may elect to set password
  > rules which require that a password contain at least one each of lower,
  > upper, number, and symbol characters.  Such a rule would be more stringent
  > than the Global Password Rules default settings which have no such
  > complexity requirements but would not be more secure than those default
  > rules according to studies on the matter. In fact, defining rules with
  > greater stringency may well result in less security than that offered by the
  > default Global Password Rules.

  The default Global Password Rules are largely compatible with "Authenticator
  Assurance Level 1" as defined by the National Institute of Standards and
  Technology's [Special Publication 800-63B](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#sec4).
  For guidelines on the specific rules that may be configured, see
  `t:MsbmsSystAuthentication.Types.password_rule_params/0`.  Note that
  "Authenticator" in the NIST document context is not the same as we've defined
  above.

  A special additional type of Global Password Rule exists referred to as the
  Disallowed Password list.  This is a list of passwords that are well known or
  are known to be compromised and that, because of this, are disallowed from
  usage so long as the "Disallow Compromised" rule is in effect.  Disallowed
  Passwords are stored as SHA-1 hashes of the password for reasonable
  obfuscation of the passwords and for compatibility with services such as those
  that are available from services such as "[Have I Been Pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)".

  #### Rate Limits

  The system attempts to dissuade brute force hacking efforts by implementing
  limits on the number of failed authentication attempts which are allowed.
  There are currently two Rate Limits implemented.

  The first enforces that an identifier may not be used in any more than five
  consecutive failed authentication attempts in any 30 minute period.  After the
  fifth failure, the identifier will immediately be prevented from participating
  in any further authentication attempts for the remainder of the 30 minute
  window.

  The second Rate Limit is host IP based.  Any host IP address seen to have 30
  consecutive authentication failures over the course of two hours is
  automatically added to the Disallowed Hosts list and prevented from further
  attempts to authenticate until an administrator removes the host from the
  list.  This Rate Limit is only applied to host IP addresses which are only
  allowed access due to the implied default Network Rule; any explicitly allowed
  host IP address is exempted from this Rate Limit.

  Any successful authentication event will reset the counters enforcing either
  of the Rate Limits.

  Adds a new password to the Disallowed Passwords list.

  Disallowed passwords are passwords that are commonly known, are known to have
  been revealed in a successful hacking attack, or are otherwise not available
  for users to choose for their authentication credential.  Enforcing that these
  passwords are not available for use depends upon the effective
  `disallow_compromised` Password Rule for the Access Account attempting
  authentication.

  An attempt to add a password which is already on the list will succeed as
  though the password were not already part of the list.

  ## Parameters

    * `password` - The plaintext password to add to the list of disallowed
    passwords.

  ## Examples

  Adding a password successfully will simply return `:ok`.

  Returns the Network Rule which should be applied for the given Host IP Address.

  This function compares the provided Host IP Address against the applicable
  Network Rules which apply to it and return the specific rule which should be
  applied during the authentication process.

  ## Network Rule Precedence

  The specific rules to check for applicability depends on the other provided
  parameters.  The available Network Rule sets in order of precedence are:

    1. __Disallowed Hosts__: Globally disallowed hosts are always checked first and
    no later rule can override the denial.  Only removing the host from the
    Disallowed Hosts List can reverse this denial.

    2. __Global Network Rules__: These are rules applied to all presented Host IP
    Addresses.

    3. __Instance Network Rules__: Rules defined by Instance Owners and are the
    most granular rule level available.  These Network Rules are only evaluated
    if the `instance_id` parameter is provided.

    4. __Owner Network Rules__: Network Rules which are applicable to all
    Instances of a given Owner, provided no superseding Instance Network Rule
    was found.  This rule set is included if either the `instance_id` or
    `owner_id` parameter is provided.

    5. __Default Network Rule__: When no explicitly defined Network Rule has
    been found for a host, this rule will apply implicitly.  The current rule
    grants access from any host.

  ## Return Value

    This function returns a result tuple.  The value element of the result tuple
    is a map of type `t:MsbmsSystAuthentication.Types.applied_network_rule/0`.
    The map indicates which precedence group the rule came from, the ID of the
    Network Rule record if the rule was derived from the various Network Rule
    data tables, and the Functional Type of the rule: `:allow` meaning the
    rule explicitly allows the host to attempt an authentication, or `:deny`
    indicating that the host is not allowed to attempt authentication.

  ## Parameters

    * `host_address` - the Host IP Address which the user wishes to authenticate
    from.

    * `instance_id` - the record ID of an Instance to which the user wants to
    gain access.  This parameter is optional, though excluding this parameter
    will leave the Instance Network Rules might properly apply unevaluated.  If
    this parameter is provided, the Owner of the Instance is implied and there
    is no need to also supply the `owner_id` parameter.

    * `owner_id` - the record ID of an Owner which owns the candidate Instances
    to which the user wishes to authenticate.  This parameter is not required if
    the `instance_id` parameter has been provided.  Otherwise, this parameter is
    optional, though if the Owner has not been resolved through this parameter
    or via the `instance_id`, the Owner Network Rules that might apply to the
    authentication attempt will not be applied.

  ## Examples

    When the host is a member of the Disallowed Hosts lists.

      iex> import IP, only: [sigil_i: 2]
      iex> {:ok, %{functional_type: :deny, network_rule_id: id, precedence: :disallowed}} =

  Creates an Email/Password Authenticator for an Access Account.

  This function creates an Email Identity, Password Credential, and optionally
  an Identity Validation Authenticator (created by default).  This function is
  typically used on adding a new Access Account to the system.  The process is
  wrapped in a database transaction so if any one part of the Authenticator
  creation process fails, all parts should fail.

  This function will fail if you attempt to create an Authenticator of this
  type for an Access Account which already has one.  In the case of Email
  Identity replacement, use the specific Identity process to create a new Email
  Identity instead of this more expansive process.

  On successful save of the Authenticator records, a success tuple is returned
  where the value element of the tuple will include basic data that might be
  required for later processing.

  If Email/Password Authenticator was created requiring validation (the
  default), the success tuple's value element will include data required to
  process the Validation Authenticator:


      {:ok,
        %{
          access_account_id: "c3c7fafd-5c45-11ed-ab46-f3d9be809bf9",

  Note that this is the only time the Validation Authenticator is provided and
  the Validation Credential plaintext is not recoverable after this return value
  is provided.

  When a Validation Authenticator is not created, no validation data will be

  Revokes the Recovery Token Authenticator for a previously initiated Password
  Credential recovery.

  While Recovery Token Authenticators expire of their own accord after a time,
  they may also explicitly be revoked.  In reality this means simply deleting
  the Recovery Token Authenticator from the system.

  The return value of this function on successful execution will be the success
  tuple `{:ok, :deleted}`.  If a recovery is not already underway for the
  requested Access Account, the function will return successfully but will
  indicate that no action took place with a return of `{:ok, :not_found}`.  Any
  other condition is an error condition and the return value will be an error
  tuple indicating the nature of the issue.

  ## Parameters

    * `access_account_id` - identifies the Access Account for whom the Recovery
    Token Authenticator should be revoked.  The expected value is the record ID
    of the Access Account.

    * `access_account_id` - the record ID of the Access Account for which to
    create the API Token Authenticator.

    * `opts` - a Keyword List of optional values which changes the default
    behavior of the Authenticator creation process.  Available options are:

      * `identity_token_length` - this option overrides the default number of
      random characters to generate for the API Token Identity identifier. The

      * `identity_tokens` - overrides the default character set to use in the
      generation of the API Token Identity identifier.  The default value is
      `:mixed_alphanum`.  See the `MsbmsSystUtils.get_random_string/2`
      documentation for the `tokens` parameter which receives this option for
      more information regarding valid values for this setting.

      * `external_name` - API Token Identities permit Access Account holder
      naming of the Identity as it may be common for an one Access Account to
      require multiple API Token Authenticators for different purposes.  This
      option allows that name to be set at Identity creation time.  The default
      value is `nil`.

      * `credential_token_length` - this option overrides the default number of
      random characters to generate for the API Token Credential. The default
      number of characters generated is 40.

      * `credential_tokens` - overrides the default character set to use in the

  Identities and authenticates an Access Account using an Email/Password
  Authenticator.

  The return value of this function is a result tuple where a success tuple
  (`{:ok, <value>}`) indicates that the function processed without error, not
  that the authentication was successful.  The value element of the success
  tuple, the Authentication State, carries information about the outcome of the
  authentication attempt; see
  `t:MsbmsSystAuthentication.Types.authentication_state/0` for more about the
  specific information carried by the Authentication State value.  Otherwise,
  an error tuple is returned indicating the nature of the processing failure.

  Email/Password authentication is an interruptible process, meaning that this
  function may return prior to the authentication having been fully processed to
  a final result.  The two most common examples of when this partial processing
  may happen are 1) the Application Instance was not initially identified; and
  2) further authentication is required such as when Multi-Factor Authentication
  is required.  In these cases the returned Authentication State is resubmitted
  for process via `authenticate_email_password/2` along with the updated
  information which allows authentication processing to complete.

  ## Parameters

    * `email_address` - this is the username in the form of an email address
    used to identify the correct Email Identity record which in turn identifies
    a specific Access Account.

    * `plaintext_pwd` - the Access Account holder's password as submitted in
    plaintext.  This is the credential that will be authenticated using the
    Password Credential record belonging to the identified Access Account.

    * `host_address` - the apparent origin host IP address from where the
    authentication attempt is originating.  This value is used in the
    enforcement of applicable Network Rules.

    * `opts` - a Keyword List of values that either optionally override default
    behaviors of this function, are optionally required, or are required on a
    deferred basis (eventually required).  The available options are:

      * `owning_owner_id` - if the Access Account is an Owned Access Account,
      this value must be set to the record ID of the Access Account's Owner.
      Otherwise it must be set `nil` or not provided.  The default value is
      `nil`.

      * `instance_id` - the record ID of the Application Instance to which the
      Access Account holder wishes to authenticate.  This is not required when
      the Email/Password authentication process is initiated but is required for
      it to complete.  If this value is not initially provided, the function
      will be `interrupted` returning an Authentication State status value of
      `:pending`.  Deferral may be appropriate if, for example, we want to allow
      the Access Account holder to select the specific Instance they wish to
      access from a list of their permitted Instances.  The default value of
      this option is `nil`.

      * `host_ban_rate_limit` - overrides the default host IP address based Rate
      Limit.  The value is set via a tuple in the following form:
      `{<Maximum Attempts>, <Time Window in Seconds>}`.  The default value is 30
      attempts over a time window of 2 hours.

      * `identifier_rate_limit` - overrides the default identifier based Rate
      Limit.  The value is set via a tuple in the following form:
      `{<Maximum Attempts>, <Time Window in Seconds>}`.  The default value is 5
