  @moduledoc """
  A simple listing of "banned" IP address which are not allowed to authenticate
  their users to the system.

  This registry differs from the syst_*_network_rules tables in that IP
  addresses here are registered as the result of automatic system heuristics
  whereas the network rules are direct expressions of system administrator
  intent.  The timing between these two mechanisms is also different in that
  records in this table are evaluated prior to an authentication attempt and
  most network rules are processed in the authentication attempt sequence.
