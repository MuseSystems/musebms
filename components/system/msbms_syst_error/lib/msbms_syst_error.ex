defmodule MsbmsSystError do

  @moduledoc """
  API for working with the MuseBMS error reporting subsystem.

  This module defines a nested structure for reporting errors in contexts where a result type ends
  in an error state.  By capturing lower level errors and reporting them in a standard way, various
  application errors, especially non-fatal errors, can be handled appropriate and logged for later
  analysis.

  The basic form of a reportable application error is: {:error, %MsbmsSystError{}} where
  %MsbmsSystError{} contains basic fields to identify the kind of error, the source of the error.

  Functions in this API are used to work with the returned struct.

  alias MsbmsSystError.Types

  @typedoc """
  Defines a nestable exception format for reporting MuseBMS application exceptions.t().

  Fields in the exception are:
    * __code__

      Classifies the error into a specific kind of exception likely to be seen in application.  Useful for pattern matching, logging, and determining if any raised exception should be handled or not.

    * __message__

      The text description of the error condition.  This should be meaningful to humans.

    * __cause__

      This value may be either another %MsbmsSystError{} value representing a more fundamental cause or other metadata helpful in understanding the cause of the error. Values found here, in addition to other %MsbmsSystError{} values, could include maps of function parameters/values or lower level exceptions that originate from included dependencies or libraries like database connection libraries.

  @doc """
  The %MsbmsSystError{} struct (the Error Struct) may represent arbitrarily nested Error Structs in
  the `cause:` attribute of the Error Struct.

  This function will traverse the nesting and return the bottom most Error Struct.  If some other
  object, such as a standard error tuple is passed to the function, the function will simply return
  the value.
