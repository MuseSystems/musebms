# MscmpSystPerms - Permissions Definition & Management

API providing for the definition and management of user permissions.

Note that this is not an authorization module as we do not grant permissions to
users here.  We only define what permissions exist and the manner in which they
exist (i.e. simple boolean vs. degrees of access).
