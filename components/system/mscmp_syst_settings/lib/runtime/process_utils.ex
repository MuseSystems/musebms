  # Small utility functions to deal with the Process dependent state.

  ######

  # Greatly inspired by what Ecto.Repo is doing to make dynamic repos work.
  # Our use case is similar in that our service naming is typically static for
  # the life of the process where it is set and may be called on frequently for
  # the life of the process.  This feels like the appropriate use of the Process
  # Dictionary and it doesn't feel like abusive of use of process global state.
