  Values indicating the state of the database which backs a given Datastore.

      subsystem.

  Defines the available states in which a context may exist.

    * `:not_found` - The database role backing the context was not found on the
      Datastore database server.

    * `:not_ready` - The database role backing the context exists, but is not
      completely set up yet.  This is an interim stage that usually has to cross
      transaction boundaries.

    * `:not_started` - When starting contexts the system doesn't check for the
       existence of each context which in turn means that a start failure could
       be indicative of either non-existence or some other problem.  In these
       start-up scenarios the state would be `:not_started`.

      the database connections for the context have not been started yet.

      context have already been started.

      the migrations installed.  This is also the value reported when the
      `database_state_values()` value for the Datastore is `:not_found`.

    * `:not_updated` - The Datastore database exists and has been initialized,
      but does not have the most recent migrations available applied per the
      migrations management table.

  Defines operators for use in comparison functions.

  These operators are used in conjunction with the `MscmpSystDb.DbTypes`
  and `MscmpSystDb.DbTypes.Range` protocols.

  The range related operator values are generally the same as those defined by
  the PostgreSQL database range types, but there are some small differences.

    * `:gt` - left is greater than right.

    * `:lt` - left is less than right.

    * `:eq` - the values are equal.

    * `:lcr` - left contains right.

    * `:rcl` - right contains left.

    * `:gto` - greater than overlapping.

    * `:lto` - less than overlapping.
