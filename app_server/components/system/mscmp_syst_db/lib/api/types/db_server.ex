  Provides the definition of a database server which can back application

  ## Attributes

    * `:server_name` - Provides a unique identifier for a database server
    instance.

    * `:start_server_instances` - If true, indicates that databases on the
    server can be started and made available as application Datastores.

    * `:server_pools` - The server pools in which the database server
    participates.

    * `:db_host` - The hostname or IP address of the database server on the
    network.

    * `:db_port` - The TCP port on which the database server is listening for
    connections.

    * `:db_show_sensitive` - If true, various logging events may show unredacted
    "sensitive" database connectivity information.  Note that even when false,
    the application still log sensitive application data.


    * `:db_max_instances` - The total number of databases allowed to be
    established for the db_server instance.

    * `:server_salt` - For certain cryptographic operations, such as password
    derivation, allows for the assignment of specific salting value for that is
    specific to a given database server.  This value must be at least 32 bytes
    long and should be a random string.

    * `:dbadmin_password` - The ms_syst_privileged role password for privileged
    operations such as creating a new database/Datastore or new database roles
    on the database server instance.

    * `:dbadmin_pool_size` - The pool size to use for creating connections for
    privileged operations using the ms_syst_privileged role.

  See `MscmpSystDb.Types.DbServer` for more.
