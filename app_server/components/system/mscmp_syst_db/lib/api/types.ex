  @typedoc """
  The value type for names which describe a specific instance of an
  Application's Datastore Context.

  A Context Name provides a reference to a specific Instance's database access
  in a way that decouples the application reference name from the database role
  which that name represents.

  This name will commonly be used as the registered name for the Datastore
  Context when registering the associated database repository `pid` value.

  @type context_name() :: String.t() | atom()

  The extended naming value of a Datastore Context for use when starting a
  Datastore Context.

  This name can include process registry information and takes the same for as
  that allowed for `GenServer` naming.
  """
  @type context_service_name() :: GenServer.name() | nil

  @typedoc """
  The allowable Datastore Context name registration options.

  Values of this type describe the available options for registering a Datastore
  Context name.  The options are:

    * `:global` - the Datastore Context name is registered globally and can be
      using the Erlang `:global` registry.

    * `{:via, module()}` - the Datastore Context name is registered
      using the identified module which must implement the Registry behaviour.

    * `nil` - the Datastore Context name will be registered locally using the
      VM's built-in registration mechanisms.  In this case the Datastore Context
      name must be represented as an atom.

  Defines the available states in which a context may exist.

    * `:not_found` - The database role backing the context was not found on the
      Datastore database server.

    * `:not_ready` - The database role backing the context exists, but is not
      completely set up yet.  This is an interim stage that usually has to cross
      transaction boundaries.

    * `:not_started` - When starting contexts the system doesn't check for the
       existence of each context which in turn means that a start failure could
       be indicative of either non-existence or some other problem.  In these
       start-up scenarios the state would be `:not_started`.

    * `:ready` - The context was found and may be connected to the database, but
      the database connections for the context have not been started yet.

    * `:started` - The context was found and database connections for the
      context have already been started.

      subsystem.

      `database_state_values()` value for the Datastore is `:not_found`.

    * `:not_updated` - The Datastore database exists and has been initialized,
      but does not have the most recent migrations available applied per the
      migrations management table.

  Defines operators for use in comparison functions.

  These operators are used in conjunction with the `MscmpSystDb.DbTypes`
  and `MscmpSystDb.DbTypes.Range` protocols.

  The range related operator values are generally the same as those defined by
  the PostgreSQL database range types, but there are some small differences.

    * `:gt` - left is greater than right.

    * `:lt` - left is less than right.

    * `:eq` - the values are equal.

    * `:lcr` - left contains right.

    * `:rcl` - right contains left.

    * `:gto` - greater than overlapping.

    * `:lto` - less than overlapping.
