  # Note that this module exists mostly to wrap library APIs which provide
  # proper cryptographic functions.  We wrap things here so that we can have
  # some flexibility in which libraries to expose to the rest of the
  # application. For example, the currently favored Argon2 password hashing
  # algorithm provided by comeonin is documented as being difficult to build on
  # Windows; so for Windows builds we may need to use a different algorithm
  # here.

  # The function below attempts to eliminate certain timing attacks which could
  # otherwise see cases where we didn't run an actual verification of a
  # credential.  Note that mimicking the hash process time by itself is may not
  # be sufficient, just likely better than no effort.  In addition to hash
  # processing there are various database queries and the like leading up to an
  # attempt to process a hash which also contribute to total authentication
  # time.  Depending on where authentication failed one or more of these queries
  # or processes may not have run possibly revealing timing discrepancies that
  # could be interpreted by an attacker.
