    of functional type suspended only certain basic Access Account maintenance
    functionality is permitted to the Access Account holder.  Regular usage is
    naturally denied.

  Represents the return value of functions which evaluate whether or not a
  specific originating host IP address is allowed to attempt an authentication.

  When an authentication is attempted, a number of different rules and data
  sources may determine what kind of connection is allowed based on the host IP
  address from which the attempt appears to be originating and the destination
  Instance for which the authentication is being processed.  To normalize the
  return from the evaluation of these different network based evaluations we
  define a simplified `t:applied_network_rule/0` value to represent the
  actionable data of the evaluation.

  ## Attributes

    * `precedence` - this will indicate the precedence of the applied Network
    Rule.  This value can aid in identifying the origin of a given applied
    allowance or denial.

    * `network_rule_id` - this is the record ID of the rule which was evaluated
    to govern the authentication attempt.  Which specific relation the ID refers
    to will depend on the specific precedence of the rule applied.  This value
    may be `nil` if the implied default Network Rule is applied since, by
    definition, this means no other explicitly defined Network Rule was found.

    * `functional_type` - May be either `:allow` or `:deny`.  `:allow` means
    that the Network Rule evaluation allows the host IP address to attempt
    authentication.  `:deny` indicates that the host IP address may not attempt
    an authentication.

  certain defined points where an authentication attempt may be interrupted.
  Examples of such interruptions include when Multi-Factor Authentication is
  required or when the password requires resetting prior to proceeding.  In all
  of these cases, we have some action that must take place, including possibly
  user interactive actions, which must be completed before the full

  The return type describing the result of authentication attempts via the
  authentication functions.

  When a user attempts to validate an Access Account, the result is returned as
  a value of this type. This includes whether or not an authentication attempt
  was successful or rejected.

  An result indicating that the status is pending may also be returned from an
  attempt if the authentication requires intervention to complete successfully.

  ## Attributes

    * `status` - the result of the authentication attempt.

    * `deadline` - the date/time by which the authentication attempt must be
    resolved by before being considered expired.  Since the authentication
    process may be interrupted and resumed, it requires that we establish some
    limit by which the process must be completed.  By default this value will be
    5 minutes after the time the authentication process starts.

    * `access_account_id` - the Access Account record ID if the authentication
    attempt has successfully completed the identification operation.

    * `instance_id` - the Instance ID that the Access Account holder is
    attempting to authenticate to.  For certain authentication types, this value
    may initially be `nil`, but must be non-nil prior to a successful completion
    of the authentication process.

    * `identity_type_id` - the record ID referencing the Identity Type used to
    identify the Access Account.

    * `host_address` -  the apparent Host IP Address from which the
    authentication attempt originated.

    * `applied_network_rule` - the Network Rule that was applied during the
    authentication attempt.  This value may be `nil` if the evaluation of the
    Network Rules has not yet made.

    * `pending_operations` - the ordered list of remaining authentication
    operations which must complete successfully prior to the authentication
    being successfully completed.

    * `identifier` - the user supplied account identifier used to identify the
    Access Account.

    * `plaintext_credential` - the unencrypted, user supplied credential to
    test during the authentication process.  This value will be made `nil` as
    soon as it has been tested or is created `nil` for the Account Code
    Authenticator which isn't a true authentication method (it's just a lookup).

    * `owning_owner_id` - an Owner record ID for the Owner which manages the
    authenticating Access Account in cases where it's an Owned Access Account.

    * `identity_id` - the record ID of the Identity record located to identify
    the Access Account.

    * `identity` - the Identity record data struct.  This should be the same
    record as that identified by the `identity_id` attribute

    * `reset_reason` - in cases where a pending operation of
    `:require_credential_reset` is added to the authentication process, this
    value indicates the reason for the reset.  Available values are defined in
    `t:credential_reset_reason/0`.

  The understood life-cycle states of the authentication process.

  Any authentication process will exist in one of the states defined by the
  list below.  The list is used to populate the `status` field of the
  `t:authentication_state/0` type.

  Note that while the authentication process may provide the caller information
  regarding the nature of any rejection, the developer should nonetheless make
  well considered judgements regarding what, if any, detail to disclose to the
  user attempting authentication.  More often than not no specificity for a
  rejection should be given.

    * `:not_started` - the authentication process has not yet begun.

    * `:pending` - the authentication process is underway.   It is possible for
    a call to an authentication function to return a `:pending` authentication
    state status.  In these cases the authentication has been interrupted and
    requires intervention to proceed.

    * `:rejected_host_check` - the authentication process has rejected the
    authentication attempt because the apparent Host IP Address is not allowed
    to authenticate as presented.

    * `:rejected_rate_limited` - the authentication process has rejected the
    authentication attempt because the identifier has failed to successfully
    authenticate within the prescribed number of tries within a prescribed
    duration.

    * `:rejected_validation` - the authentication process has rejected the
    authentication attempt because the identity used to identify the Access
    Account is subject to prior validation/confirmation by the Access Account
    holder.  This is the case with newly created Email Identities, for example.

    * `:rejected_identity_expired` - the authentication process has rejected the
    authentication attempt because the Identity record used to identity the
    Access Account is beyond its configured expiration date and may not be use
    again until the Identity's expiration has been reset.  Note that not all
    Identity records expire.

    * `:rejected_deadline_expired` - the authentication process is rejected
    because it has taken too long to resolve to a final authentication status.

    * `:rejected` - the authentication process has rejected the authentication
    attempt for undeclared reasons.  Examples of reasons that can prompt this
    authentication end state are a user providing a wrong password or no
    Instance to access being identified.

  The return type used when creating Authenticators via the API.

  The included values and attributes will vary somewhat from Authenticator type
  to Authenticator type, but they will all follow this basic form.

  ## Attributes

    * `access_account_id` - the Access Account record ID for which the
    Authenticator has been created.

    * `account_identifier` - the Access Account Identifier for use in
    identifying the Access Account in the authentication process.  Depending on
    the Authenticator type, this could be a restatement of what the user
    provided, such as an Email address, or may be system generated such as the
    identifier for user with an API Token.

    * `credential` - the plaintext Credential created for the Authenticator.
    This attribute is only returned in cases where the typical Authenticator
    creation flow includes the system randomly generating the Credential.  For
    example, an API Token Credential is automatically created by the system and
    the Credential must be communicated to the user once created.  Note that
    even in these cases the only time the Credential is available for disclosure
    to the user is immediately after the Authenticator creation via this value.
    Once the return result is discarded the Credential is unrecoverable.

    * `validation_identifier` - when creating an Email/Password Authenticator,
    the default options mandate that validating the Email Identity is required.
    Assuming the default is not overridden, the system generated Identifier for
    the user to use to validate the Email Identity is provided via this
    attribute.  If validation is not required this attribute will not be present
    in the return value of the Authenticator creation call.

    * `validation_credential` - the (usually) system generated Credential in
    plaintext which compliments the `validation_identifier` value.  This
    attribute is either included or excluded on the same terms as the
    `validation_identifier`.  Note that the return of this value after
    the creation of an Email/Password Authenticator is the only time that this

    * `password_length` - the resolved value of type
    `t:MscmpSystDb.DbTypes.IntegerRange.t/0` describing the password
    length in terms of the number of characters.  The lower bound defines the
    minimum number of characters a password may have and the upper bound is the
