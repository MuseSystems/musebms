  Invites or re-invites an Access Account to establish access rights to a

  The invitation process creates a `syst_access_account_instance_assocs` record
  for the requested Access Account and Instance and sets the `invitation_issued`
  field to the current date/time.  Re-invitation will update an existing
  `syst_access_account_instance_assocs` record resetting invite data such as the
  invitation expiration date or resetting the declined state if the record was
  previously declined by the Access Account holder. Once a
  `syst_access_account_instance_assocs` record is accepted, it may not be re-
  invited again using this process until the record is revoked (deleted).

  `syst_access_account_instance_assocs` are unique to the Access Account and
  Instance combination and only one such record may exist for that combination
  at any one time.

  ## Parameters

    * `access_account_id` - the record ID of the Access Account to invite to the
    Instance.

  Bulk loads a list of passwords into the Disallowed Passwords database table.

  Typically this function will be used to receive a stream of passwords which
  should be added to the system Disallowed Passwords list.  The passwords
  passed to this function are streamed into the PostgreSQL database via a
  `COPY ms_syst.syst_disallowed_passwords FROM` command.

  The system Disallowed Password List is stored using SHA-1 hashes of the
  disallowed passwords to prevent the casual disclosure of possibly sensitive
  information including so called "Personally Identifiable Information" (PII).
  If passwords to this function are provided via plain text this function will
  convert them to the expected SHA-1 representation.

  ## Parameters

    * `password_list` - A required Enumerable of passwords to disallow. The
    passwords in this list are accepted in one of two possible formats: simple
    plain text passwords or as sha1 hashes represented using PostgreSQL's `bytea`
    textual export format (e.g. "example_pg_disallowed" =
    "\\\\x32dc749fd3ef7bcf79d125a3f9146c0f122f8763").  Which is expected depends
    on the `pg_format` option described below.

    > #### Plain Text Processing Tip {: .tip}
    >
    > If the `password_list` is using the plain text representation, some
    > sources, such as `File.stream!/3` may add an extraneous newline (or
    > similar) to the password which must be stripped prior to passing to this
    > function.  Failing to do so will result in incorrect hashing and the
    > requested passwords will not be effectively disallowed.

    * `options` - An optional Keyword List of settings with which the caller can
    influence the behavior of this function.  The available options are:

      * `pg_format` - a boolean value which indicates the format that the source
      passwords are being provided in.  If true, the passwords to disallow are
      expected to be already be SHA-1 hashed and represented using PostgreSQL's
      `bytea` textual representation; if false, the passwords are assumed to be
      represented using simple plain text which will be transformed as needed by

      where a substantial amount of data might be processed; certainly enough

  Returns the Network Rule which should be applied for the given Host IP Address.

  This function compares the provided Host IP Address against the applicable
  Network Rules which apply to it and return the specific rule which should be
  applied during the authentication process.

  ## Network Rule Precedence

  The specific rules to check for applicability depends on the other provided
  parameters.  The available Network Rule sets in order of precedence are:

    1. __Disallowed Hosts__: Globally disallowed hosts are always checked first and
    no later rule can override the denial.  Only removing the host from the
    Disallowed Hosts List can reverse this denial.

    2. __Global Network Rules__: These are rules applied to all presented Host IP
    Addresses.

    3. __Instance Network Rules__: Rules defined by Instance Owners and are the
    most granular rule level available.  These Network Rules are only evaluated
    if the `instance_id` parameter is provided.

    4. __Owner Network Rules__: Network Rules which are applicable to all
    Instances of a given Owner, provided no superseding Instance Network Rule
    was found.  This rule set is included if either the `instance_id` or
    `owner_id` parameter is provided.

    5. __Default Network Rule__: When no explicitly defined Network Rule has
    been found for a host, this rule will apply implicitly.  The current rule
    grants access from any host.

  ## Return Value

    This function returns a result tuple.  The value element of the result tuple
    is a map of type `t:MscmpSystAuthn.Types.AppliedNetworkRule.t/0`.
    The map indicates which precedence group the rule came from, the ID of the
    Network Rule record if the rule was derived from the various Network Rule
    data tables, and the Functional Type of the rule: `:allow` meaning the
    rule explicitly allows the host to attempt an authentication, or `:deny`
    indicating that the host is not allowed to attempt authentication.

  ## Parameters

    * `host_address` - the Host IP Address which the user wishes to authenticate
    from.

    * `instance_id` - the record ID of an Instance to which the user wants to
    gain access.  This parameter is optional, though excluding this parameter
    will leave the Instance Network Rules might properly apply unevaluated.  If
    this parameter is provided, the Owner of the Instance is implied and there
    is no need to also supply the `owner_id` parameter.

    * `owner_id` - the record ID of an Owner which owns the candidate Instances
    to which the user wishes to authenticate.  This parameter is not required if
    the `instance_id` parameter has been provided.  Otherwise, this parameter is
    optional, though if the Owner has not been resolved through this parameter
    or via the `instance_id`, the Owner Network Rules that might apply to the
    authentication attempt will not be applied.

  ## Examples

    When the host is a member of the Disallowed Hosts lists.

  Creates an Email/Password Authenticator for an Access Account.

  This function creates an Email Identity, Password Credential, and optionally
  an Identity Validation Authenticator (created by default).  This function is
  typically used on adding a new Access Account to the system.  The process is
  wrapped in a database transaction so if any one part of the Authenticator
  creation process fails, all parts should fail.

  This function will fail if you attempt to create an Authenticator of this
  type for an Access Account which already has one.  In the case of Email
  Identity replacement, use the specific Identity process to create a new Email
  Identity instead of this more expansive process.

  On successful save of the Authenticator records, a success tuple is returned
  where the value element of the tuple will include basic data that might be
  required for later processing.

  If Email/Password Authenticator was created requiring validation (the
  default), the success tuple's value element will include data required to
  process the Validation Authenticator:


      {:ok,
        %{
          access_account_id: "c3c7fafd-5c45-11ed-ab46-f3d9be809bf9",

  Allows for an existing password to be changed to a new password.

  The assumption is that a Password Credential already exists and that only the

  This function ensures that the new password meets all applicable Password 
  Rules prior to completing the change.  This function will not allow you to set

  the plaintext credential; after the return value of the function is disposed
  of there is no way to once again retrieve the plaintext of the Validation
  Token Credential.

  Once the Validation Token Authenticator has been successfully created, the
  target Identity (typically an Email Identity) may not be used for
  authentication until the Validation Token itself has been successfully
  authenticated via the `authenticate_validation_token/4` function.

  The created Validation Token Authenticator will expire after a time.  After
  expiration the the Authenticator will no longer be to be authenticated by
  `authenticate_validation_token/4`.  The only way to validate the target
  Identity at that point is to create a new Validation Token Authenticator for
  the Identity using this function.

  ## Parameters

    * `target_identity` - either the record ID or the
    `Msdata.SystIdentities` struct of the Identity record
    to validate.  Typically this Identity will be an Email Identity.

    * `opts` - a Keyword List of options which can change the behavior to the
    Identity validation request.  The available options are:

      * `expiration_hours` - overrides the default number of hours after which

      Validation Authenticator expires 24 hours after creation.

      * `identity_token_length` - this option overrides the default number of
      random characters to generate for the Validation Token Identity
      identifier.  The default number of characters generated is 40.

      * `identity_tokens` - overrides the default character set to use in the

      * `credential_token_length` - this option overrides the default number of

  Access Account Password Credentials are only recoverable when they: 1) exist,
  and 2) are not already awaiting recovery.  When the Password Credential is
  recoverable this function will return a simple `:ok` value.  If the Access
  Account's Password Credential already has an issued recovery underway, the
  value `:existing_recovery` is returned.  If the Access Account lacks a
  Password Credential record to recover, the value `:not_found` is returned. Any

  Requests to start a Password Credential recovery process for the specified
  Access Account.

  Assuming that the Access Account's Password Credential exists and isn't
  already being recovered, this function will create a new Recovery Token
  Authenticator for the Access Account's Password Credential.

  On successful creation of the requested Recovery Token Authenticator, an
  Authenticator Result will be returned as the value element of a success tuple:

      { :ok,
        %{
          access_account_id: "c3c7fafd-5c45-11ed-ab46-f3d9be809bf9",

      }}

  Importantly, the system generated Recovery Token account identifier and
  plaintext credential are returned to the caller.  This is the only opportunity
  to obtain the plaintext credential; after the return value of the function is
  disposed of there is no way to once again retrieve the plaintext of the
  Recovery Token Credential.

  The existence of a Recovery Token Authenticator for a Password Credential does
  not prevent that Password Credential from continuing to be used in the
  authentication process.

  A Recovery Token Authenticator will expire after a time.  After expiration the
  Recovery Token will no longer be able to be authenticated with
  `authenticate_recovery_token/4`.  Any further recovery of the Password
  Credential will require a new Recovery Token be created.

  ## Parameters

    * `access_account_id` - the record ID of the Access Account to which the
    Password Credential needing recovering belongs.

    * `opts` - a Keyword List of options which can change the behavior to the
    password recovery request.  The available options are:

      * `expiration_hours` - overrides the default number of hours after which
      to consider the Recovery Authenticator expired.  By default the Recovery
      Authenticator expires 24 hours after creation.

      * `identity_token_length` - this option overrides the default number of

  Identities and authenticates an Access Account using an Email/Password
  Authenticator.

  The return value of this function is a result tuple where a success tuple
  (`{:ok, <value>}`) indicates that the function processed without error, not
  that the authentication was successful.  The value element of the success
  tuple, the Authentication State, carries information about the outcome of the
  authentication attempt; see
  `t:MscmpSystAuthn.Types.AuthenticationState.t/0` for more about the
  specific information carried by the Authentication State value.  Otherwise,
  an error tuple is returned indicating the nature of the processing failure.

  Email/Password authentication is an interruptible process, meaning that this
  function may return prior to the authentication having been fully processed to
  a final result.  The two most common examples of when this partial processing
  may happen are:

  1. The Application Instance was not initially identified.
  2. Further authentication is required such as when Multi-Factor Authentication
  is required.

  In these cases the returned Authentication State is resubmitted
  for processing via `authenticate_email_password/2` along with the updated
  information which allows authentication processing to complete.

  ## Parameters

    * `email_address` - this is the username in the form of an email address
    used to identify the correct Email Identity record which in turn identifies
    a specific Access Account.

    * `plaintext_pwd` - the Access Account holder's password as submitted in
    plaintext.  This is the credential that will be authenticated using the
    Password Credential record belonging to the identified Access Account.

    * `host_address` - the apparent origin host IP address from where the
    authentication attempt is originating.  This value is used in the
    enforcement of applicable Network Rules.

    * `opts` - a Keyword List of values that either optionally override default
    behaviors of this function, are optionally required, or are required on a
    deferred basis (eventually required).  The available options are:

      * `owning_owner_id` - if the Access Account is an Owned Access Account,
      this value must be set to the record ID of the Access Account's Owner.
      Otherwise it must be set `nil` or not provided.  The default value is
      `nil`.

      * `instance_id` - the record ID of the Application Instance to which the
      Access Account holder wishes to authenticate.  A final value for
      instance_id is not required when the Email/Password authentication process
      is initiated but is required for it to complete.  If this value is not
      initially provided, the function will be `interrupted` returning an
      Authentication State status value of `:pending`.  Deferral may be
      appropriate if, for example, we want to allow the Access Account holder to
      select the specific Instance they wish to access from a list of their
      permitted Instances.  Final resolution of the value must reference an
      Instance for which the Access Account permitted authentication attempts or
      must be set `:bypass` if the authentication attempt is a special case
      where a specific Instance is not relevant.  The default value of this
      option is `nil`.

      * `host_ban_rate_limit` - overrides the default host IP address based Rate
      Limit.  The value is set via a tuple in the following form:
      `{<Maximum Attempts>, <Time Window in Seconds>}`.  The default value is 30
      attempts over a time window of 2 hours.

      * `identifier_rate_limit` - overrides the default identifier based Rate
      Limit.  The value is set via a tuple in the following form:
      `{<Maximum Attempts>, <Time Window in Seconds>}`.  The default value is 5
      attempts over a time window of 30 minutes.

      * `deadline_minutes` - overrides the default number of minutes that an
      authentication process can take before being rejected for taking too long.
      This deadline is needed because an arbitrary time can pass due to user
      interaction, such as selecting an Instance or providing an MFA credential.
      The default value is 5 minutes from the time the authentication process is
      started.

      `{<Maximum Attempts>, <Time Window in Seconds>}`.  The default value is 5
      attempts over a time window of 30 minutes.

      * `deadline_minutes` - overrides the default number of minutes that an
      authentication process can take before being rejected for taking too long.
      This deadline is needed because an arbitrary time can pass due to user
      interaction if the authenticator allows for an interruptable
      authentication process.  The default deadline allows for 5 minutes to
      complete the authentication process.
