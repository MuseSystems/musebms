defmodule MscmpSystForms.Types.ComponentDisplayModes do
  @moduledoc """
  A struct defining the different kinds of display mode data which can be
  communicated to a user interface component.

  User interface components can be configured with a variety of display options,
  called "modes".  Between the functions which generate the effective modes for
  the user interface and the user interface components themselves there must be
  a standard way to communicate and this type defines the structure of that
  communication.

  It is worth noting that the Component will receive its display modes in data
  with this structure.
