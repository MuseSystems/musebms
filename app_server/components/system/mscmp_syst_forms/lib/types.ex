  The identifier type for data binding identifiers.

  Data binding identifiers are used to identify data fields in `Ecto`
  Changesets, `t:Phoenix.HTML.form.t/0` representations of data, form parameters
  as returned on submission, and in `t:MscmpSystForms.Types.FormConfig.t/0`
  form configurations.  All of these representations which are used in different
  contexts will represent the same data and this `binding_id` is the name which
  identifies the data across these logical contexts.

  @typedoc """
  Component level modes which govern the behavior of components in terms of
  interactivity, whether or not they may display data, and even if the component
  is visible to users or present in the layout.

  Each component is designed to respond appropriately when one of the following
  component modes are specified.

    * `:removed` - A component in this mode will not be visible and will not
    take space in the layout of a view.

    * `:hidden` - When a component is in this mode, the component is hidden fro
    the user, but will take space in the layout of the view as though it were
    present.

    * `:cleared` - The cleared component mode allows components to be rendered
    into the layout, but input related components will not display any of their
    associated data and will be disabled for any user interactivity.  This is
    used primarily when the user may know that a given field exists, but does
    not have permission to view the data associated with the field.

    * `:processing` - Used when some long running application process involving
    the data of the form or component has started, but not yet finished.  A
    component in processing mode will be disabled from user interaction and will
    likely change its display characteristics as appropriate for the processing
    state.

    * `:visible` - For use when a component should be present and visible on the
    screen and any associated data should be visible to the user, but the
    component should not accept user interactions.  Informally speaking this is
    the mode which enables a "view only" presentation of a component.

    * `:entry` - This component mode allows the component and its associated
    data to be visible to the user as well as allows the user to interact with
    any functionality, such as changing the data value or clicking a button,
    etc.  Informally speaking this is the "edit mode" component mode.

  A standardized set of modes which govern the styling of MscmpSystForms defined
  web components.

  * `:deemphasis` - Used in cases where we want to specific reduce attention to
  a give element.  For example `:deemphasis` might be used in cases where a web
  component is disabled for entry.  The reduction in "presence" is the greatest
  compared amongst all display modes which reduce visual presence.

  * `:reference` - For reducing attention to informational content as compared
  to actionable elements such as input fields and their labels.  In this case
  we want a visually "present" element, but not one so visually pronounced that
  is distracts from more important elements.

  * `:normal` - This display mode is the primary choice of normal input
  components as well as their labels.  This is true when the elements are active
  and actionable, but require no greater attention that most other elements with
  with they are displayed.

  * `:emphasis` - Used for elements which are active and are of greater
  importance or require more pronounced attention than other elements of the
  same class.  For example, a required input field and its label may be given
  this display mode so they stand out from all other entry fields.  Use of this
  display mode should be carefully considered as if everything is emphasized
  then nothing is.

  * `:warning` - Elements which are in a warning state and where the warning
  state requires greater attention than normal screen elements.  This display
  mode will typically change various colored elements to the established warning
  color.

  * `:alert` - When elements in the interface require heightened attention and
  are either in an error state or in conditions where greater attention than a
  warning is required.  Colored elements will typically assume the established
  alert color when this display mode is set.

  * `:approve` - A normal attention display mode where colored elements will
  assume the established approval colors.

  * `:deny` - A normal attention display mode where colored elements will assume
  the established denial colors.

  * `:info` - A normal attention display mode where colored elements will assume
  the established "information" color scheme.
