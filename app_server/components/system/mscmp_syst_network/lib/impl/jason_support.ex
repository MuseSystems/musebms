  # TODO: :noward_function is too broad an exclusion, but the only one that
  #       seems to work.  Dialyzer is complaining about :extra_range, but I
  #       can't find any magic that is either 1) a valid exclusion, 2) actually
  #       does what is expected.  In all cases either I get an error about
  #       invalid options in the attribute or the thing that looks like it might
  #       work, doesn't.  Sigh.  Try and get some guidance: the Erlang and
  #       Elixir documentation is just wholly inadequate to understand what
  #       dialyzer wants to hear from me.
