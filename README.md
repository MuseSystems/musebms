[![MSBMS Application CI](https://github.com/MuseSystems/musebms/actions/workflows/msbms_application.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/MuseSystems/musebms/actions/workflows/msbms_application.yml)

The Muse Systems Business Management System (MuseBMS) is an experimental,
whole-enterprise business management system intended to test ideas in the design
and development of this class of application. The project is under active
development, but does not offer any sort of usable software at this time.

Development of the MuseBMS is being conducted in plain sight, but currently
access to the source code and related documentation are only offered on a
"source available" basis under the terms of the ["Muse Systems Business Management System Software License Agreement v1.0"](LICENSE.md).

The documentation for the project can be found at ["https://musebms.muse.systems/docs"](https://musebms.muse.systems/docs)
