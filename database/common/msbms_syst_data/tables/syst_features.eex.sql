COMMENT ON
    TABLE msbms_syst_data.syst_features IS
$DOC$A list of features such as forms and operations and some simple metadata
describing the feature.  Categorization of features into modules and into broad
types of applicability included in the current metadata.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst_data.syst_features.id IS
$DOC$The record's primary key.  The definitive identifier of the record in the
system.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst_data.syst_features.internal_name IS
$DOC$A candidate key useful for programmatic references to individual records.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst_data.syst_features.display_name IS
$DOC$A friendly name and candidate key for the record suitable for use in user
interfaces.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst_data.syst_features.description IS
$DOC$A text describing the meaning and use of the specific record.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst_data.syst_features.syst_module_id IS
$DOC$Identifies the application module to which this document belongs.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst_data.syst_features.syst_feature_type_id IS
$DOC$Identifies the kind of document being represented.  For example 'Master
Data' or 'Booking Transaction'.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst_data.syst_features.diag_timestamp_created IS
$DOC$The database server date/time when the transaction which created the record
started.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst_data.syst_features.diag_role_created IS
$DOC$The database role which created the record.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst_data.syst_features.diag_timestamp_modified IS
$DOC$The database server date/time when the transaction which modified the record
started.  This field will be the same as diag_timestamp_created for inserted
records.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst_data.syst_features.diag_wallclock_modified IS
$DOC$The database server date/time at the moment the record was actually modified.
For long running transactions this time may be significantly later than the
value of diag_timestamp_modified.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst_data.syst_features.diag_role_modified IS
$DOC$The database role which modified the record.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst_data.syst_features.diag_row_version IS
$DOC$The current version of the row.  The value here indicates how many actual
data changes have been made to the row.  If an update of the row leaves all data
fields the same, disregarding the updates to the diag_* columns, the row version
is not updated, nor are any updates made to the other diag_* columns other than
diag_update_count.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst_data.syst_features.diag_update_count IS
$DOC$Records the number of times the record has been updated regardless as to if
the update actually changed any data.  In this way needless or redundant record
updates can be found.  This row starts at 0 and therefore may be the same as the
diag_row_version - 1.$DOC$;
