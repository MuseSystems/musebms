COMMENT ON
    VIEW msbms_syst.syst_settings IS
$DOC$Configuration data which establishes application behaviors, defaults, and
provides a reference center to interested application functionality.

This API View allows the application to read and maintain the data according to
well defined application business rules.  Using this API view for updates to
data is the preferred method of data maintenance in the course of normal usage.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_settings.id IS
$DOC$The record's primary key.  The definitive identifier of the record in the
system.

Note that this column may not be updated via this API View.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_settings.internal_name IS
$DOC$A candidate key useful for programmatic references to individual records.

Note that this column may not be updated via this API View, though an initial
insert operation may set it initially$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_settings.display_name IS
$DOC$A friendly name and candidate key for the record suitable for use in user
interfaces.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_settings.syst_defined IS
$DOC$When true, indicates that the setting was created as part of the system and is
expected to exist.  If false, the setting is user created and maintained.

Note that this column may not be updated via this API View.$DOC$;

Note that this column may not be updated via this API View.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_settings.user_description IS
$DOC$A user customizable override of the system description text.  When the value in
this column is not NULL, this text will be displayed to users in preference to
the description found in syst_description.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_settings.setting_flag IS
$DOC$A boolean configuration point.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_settings.setting_integer IS
$DOC$An integer configuration point$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_settings.setting_integer_range IS
$DOC$An integer range configuration point.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_settings.setting_decimal IS
$DOC$An decimal configuration point (not floating point).$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_settings.setting_decimal_range IS
$DOC$A decimal range configuration point.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON

Note that this column may not be updated via this API View.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_settings.diag_timestamp_modified IS
$DOC$The database server date/time when the transaction which modified the record
started.  This field will be the same as diag_timestamp_created for inserted
records.

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_settings.diag_wallclock_modified IS
$DOC$The database server date/time at the moment the record was actually modified.
For long running transactions this time may be significantly later than the

Note that this column may not be updated via this API View.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_settings.diag_role_modified IS
$DOC$The database role which modified the record.

Note that this column may not be updated via this API View.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_settings.diag_row_version IS
