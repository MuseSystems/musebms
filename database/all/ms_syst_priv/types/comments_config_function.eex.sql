COMMENT ON TYPE ms_syst_priv.comments_config_function IS
$DOC$Defines the structure of documentation for database procedural code
(`PROCEDURE`, `FUNCTION`) and allows for the automatic generation of formatted
documentation.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN ms_syst_priv.comments_config_function.function_schema IS
$DOC$A text value indicating the database schema naming hosting the routine to be
commented upon.

**General Usage**

This value is required and there is no default value.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN ms_syst_priv.comments_config_function.function_name IS
$DOC$The name of the routine being commented upon.

**General Usage**

This value is required and there is no default value.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN ms_syst_priv.comments_config_function.description IS
$DOC$A description of the routine and its usage.

**General Usage**

This value is not required, though providing it is strongly recommend.  If not
provided the default is "( Routine Not Yet Documented )".$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN ms_syst_priv.comments_config_function.general_usage IS
$DOC$Notes regarding how callers should use the function and any details regarding
unobvious usage expectations.

**General Usage**

This value is not required.  If provided, a "General Usage" section will be
added to the comment including the configured text.  Otherwise the "General
Usage" section is omitted.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN ms_syst_priv.comments_config_function.trigger_function IS
$DOC$Indicates if the function is a function suitable for use as a trigger.

**General Use**

If `TRUE`, the function is a trigger function and should carry documentation
appropriate to that role.

This value is not required and defaults to `FALSE` if not set.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN ms_syst_priv.comments_config_function.trigger_timing IS
$DOC$If the function is a trigger function, this attribute will indicated at which
timings calls to the function is supported.

**General Usage**

The following values are valid in indicating the supported timings:

  * `b` - indicates that the trigger function supports `BEFORE` trigger timing.

  * `a` - indicates that the trigger function supports `AFTER` trigger timing.

  * `i` - indicates that the trigger function is a view supporting `INSTEAD OF`
    trigger.

If the trigger function supports multiple timings, simply include all supported
timing indicators as individual elements in the array.

If the function is a trigger function
(`comments_config_function.trigger_function` is `TRUE`) and this value is `NULL`
or does not include a valid indicator from the list above, the trigger timing
comment will merely state that the supported timing is not yet documented.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN ms_syst_priv.comments_config_function.trigger_ops IS
$DOC$If the function is a trigger function, this attribute will indicated which
record operations the trigger function supports.

**General Usage**

The following values are valid in indicating the supported operations:

  * `i` - indicates that the trigger function supports `INSERT` record
    operations.

  * `u` - indicates that the trigger function supports `UPDATE` trigger
    operations.

  * `d` - indicates that the trigger function supports `DELETE` trigger
    operations.

If the trigger function supports multiple operations, simply include all
supported operation indicators as individual elements in the array.

If the function is a trigger function
(`comments_config_function.trigger_function` is `TRUE`) and this value is `NULL`
or does not include a valid indicator from the list above, the trigger timing
comment will merely state that the supported timing is not yet documented.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN ms_syst_priv.comments_config_function.params IS
$DOC$A list of `ms_syst_priv.comments_config_function_param` objects which provide
comment configurations for each of the routine's parameters.

**General Usage**

This value is not required.  There is no default value provided.$DOC$;
