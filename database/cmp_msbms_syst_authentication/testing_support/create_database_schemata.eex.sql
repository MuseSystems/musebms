COMMENT ON SCHEMA msbms_syst IS
$DOC$Public API for system operations.  The important distinction is that business
data is not stored here. This schema contains procedures, functions, and views
suitable for calling outside of the application or via user customizations.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON SCHEMA msbms_syst_priv IS
$DOC$Internal, private system operations.  These functions are developed not for the
purpose of general access, but contain primitives and other internal booking-
keeping functions.  These functions should not be called directly outside of the
packaged application.$DOC$;

defined types.  The data in this schema is not related to user business data,
but rather facilitates the operation of the application as a software system.$DOC$;
