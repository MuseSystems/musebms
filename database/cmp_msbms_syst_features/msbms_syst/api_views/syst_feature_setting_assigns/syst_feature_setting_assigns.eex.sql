COMMENT ON
    VIEW msbms_syst.syst_feature_setting_assigns IS
$DOC$A join table which allows application settings to be associated with various
application features.  This is a many-to-many relationship.  The expectation is
that this association will be used in organizing certain configuration or
permissioning displays into a tree-like structure.

This API View allows the application to read and maintain the data according to
well defined application business rules.  Using this API view for updates to
data is the preferred method of data maintenance in the course of normal usage.$DOC$;
