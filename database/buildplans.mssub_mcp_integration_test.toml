##  NOTE:  This build plan exists only to facilitate automated testing,
##         continuous integration, and other similar development & testing
##         activities.  It is not used to build released software.
##

# The database should have been migrated at application start so what we're
# building here is just the data required for testing.  That will, as all other
# tests, be part of sponsor 821 ("MT").
