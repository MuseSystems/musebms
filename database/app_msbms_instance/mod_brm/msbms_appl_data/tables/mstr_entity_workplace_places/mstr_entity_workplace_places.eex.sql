$DOC$Identifies a specific place as being a valid option for person addressing, such
as mailing, etc.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_appl_data.mstr_entity_workplace_places.id IS
$DOC$The record's primary key.  The definitive identifier of the record in the
system.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_appl_data.mstr_entity_workplace_places.place_id IS
$DOC$Identifies the place which has a workplace relationship with the owning entity.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_appl_data.mstr_entity_workplace_places.owning_entity_id IS
$DOC$Establishes the entity which uses the place as a workplace.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_appl_data.mstr_entity_workplace_places.diag_timestamp_created IS
$DOC$The database server date/time when the transaction which created the record
started.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_appl_data.mstr_entity_workplace_places.diag_role_created IS

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_appl_data.mstr_entity_workplace_places.diag_timestamp_modified IS
$DOC$The database server date/time when the transaction which modified the record
started.  This field will be the same as diag_timestamp_created for inserted
records.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_appl_data.mstr_entity_workplace_places.diag_wallclock_modified IS
$DOC$The database server date/time at the moment the record was actually modified.
For long running transactions this time may be significantly later than the
value of diag_timestamp_modified.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON

$DOC$The database role which modified the record.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_appl_data.mstr_entity_workplace_places.diag_row_version IS
$DOC$The current version of the row.  The value here indicates how many actual
data changes have been made to the row.  If an update of the row leaves all data
fields the same, disregarding the updates to the diag_* columns, the row version
is not updated, nor are any updates made to the other diag_* columns other than
diag_update_count.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_appl_data.mstr_entity_workplace_places.diag_update_count IS
$DOC$Records the number of times the record has been updated regardless as to if
the update actually changed any data.  In this way needless or redundant record
updates can be found.  This row starts at 0 and therefore may be the same as the
diag_row_version - 1.$DOC$;
