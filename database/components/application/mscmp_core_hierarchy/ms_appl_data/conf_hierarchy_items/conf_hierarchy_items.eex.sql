COMMENT ON
    TABLE ms_appl_data.conf_hierarchy_items IS
$DOC$Hierarchy Item records represent a level in the hierarchy of their parent
Hierarchy. Each Hierarchy Item record is individually sequenced in its group via
the `hierarchy_depth` column.

Note that once the Hierarchy is active and in use by Hierarchy implementing
Components, most changes to the Hierarchy Item records will not be allowed to
ensure the consistency of currently used data.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN ms_appl_data.conf_hierarchy_items.id IS
$DOC$The record's primary key.  The definitive identifier of the record in the
system.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN ms_appl_data.conf_hierarchy_items.internal_name IS
$DOC$A candidate key useful for programmatic references to individual records.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN ms_appl_data.conf_hierarchy_items.display_name IS
$DOC$A friendly name and candidate key for the record, suitable for use in user
interactions$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN ms_appl_data.conf_hierarchy_items.external_name IS
$DOC$A non-unique/non-key value used to display to users and external parties where
uniqueness is less of a concern than specific end user presentation.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN  ms_appl_data.conf_hierarchy_items.hierarchy_id IS
$DOC$Identifies the Hierarchy to which the record belongs.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN ms_appl_data.conf_hierarchy_items.required IS
$DOC$Indicates if the Hierarchy Item level must be represented by a record in the
implementing data, or if the Hierarchy Item level represents an optional level.
If true, the Hierarchy Item level must be represented by a record in the data of
the implementing Component for that data to be considered valid.  If false,
the Hierarchy Item level is considered optional and the data of the implementing
Component may omit the Hierarchy Item level in its data without the data being
considered invalid.

The highest/root Hierarchy Item level must always be required.  If lower levels
of the Hierarchy are required, all parents to the lowest required Hierarchy Item
level must also be marked as required true.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN ms_appl_data.conf_hierarchy_items.allow_node_refs IS
$DOC$Indicates to implementing Components that this Hierarchy Item level can be
associated with "nodes". Nodes are not defined in the mscmp_core_hierarchy
Component, but are rather defined by Hierarchy implementing Components.  An
example of a node would be an application menu implementing Component defining
references/links to specific application functionality which are then displayed
associated to branches of a tree structure (menu/sub-menu/etc.)  The links are
nodes and the branchs of the menu are representations of the Hierarchy Items.

If this value is true, it means this Hierarchy Item record may be associated
directly with nodes.  If false, nodes must be associated with other levels of
the Hierarchy.

The bottom/lowest level Hierarchy Item must always be marked as
allow_node_refs true.  Higher than the lowest Hierarchy Item level may
arbitrarily allow or disallow node associations as the implementing Component
sees fit.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN ms_appl_data.conf_hierarchy_items.hierarchy_depth IS
$DOC$Indicates the at what level in the hierarchy this Group Type Item sits
relative to the other items in the Group Type.  Records with relatively
higher values are deeper or lower in the hierarchy.

When a value for this column is not provided at insert time, the record is
assigned the next hierarchy depth value relative to the existing records.  When
a record is inserted with a set hierarchy_depth value and that value pre-exists
for the same Group Type as the new record, the insert is treated as a "insert
above" operation, with the existing conflicting record being updated to have the
next hierarchy value; existing Group Type Item records are continued to be
updated until the last record is assigned a non-conflicting hierarchy_depth
value.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN ms_appl_data.conf_hierarchy_items.diag_timestamp_created IS
$DOC$The database server date/time when the transaction which created the record
started.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN ms_appl_data.conf_hierarchy_items.diag_role_created IS
$DOC$The database role which created the record.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN ms_appl_data.conf_hierarchy_items.diag_timestamp_modified IS
$DOC$The database server date/time when the transaction which modified the record
started.  This field will be the same as diag_timestamp_created for inserted
records.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN ms_appl_data.conf_hierarchy_items.diag_wallclock_modified IS
$DOC$The database server date/time at the moment the record was actually modified.
For long running transactions this time may be significantly later than the
value of diag_timestamp_modified.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN ms_appl_data.conf_hierarchy_items.diag_role_modified IS
$DOC$The database role which modified the record.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN ms_appl_data.conf_hierarchy_items.diag_row_version IS
$DOC$The current version of the row.  The value here indicates how many actual
data changes have been made to the row.  If an update of the row leaves all data
fields the same, disregarding the updates to the diag_* columns, the row version
is not updated, nor are any updates made to the other diag_* columns other than
diag_update_count.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN ms_appl_data.conf_hierarchy_items.diag_update_count IS
$DOC$Records the number of times the record has been updated regardless as to if
the update actually changed any data.  In this way needless or redundant record
updates can be found.  This row starts at 0 and therefore may be the same as the
diag_row_version - 1.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    CONSTRAINT conf_hierarchy_items_depth_udx
    ON ms_appl_data.conf_hierarchy_items IS
$DOC$No two records in the same Group Type should share the same hierarchy_depth
as their relationship would become ambiguous.  Group Type hierarchies are
only valuable when each individual level is uniquely placed in the hierarchy
relative to other records of the same group.$DOC$;
