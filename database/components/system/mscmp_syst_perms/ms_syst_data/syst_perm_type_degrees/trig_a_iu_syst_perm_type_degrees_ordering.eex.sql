COMMENT ON FUNCTION ms_syst_data.trig_a_iu_syst_perm_type_degrees_ordering() IS
$DOC$Automatically maintains the ordering of syst_perm_type_degrees records in cases
where the ordering column value collides with an existing syst_perm_type_degrees
record sharing the same parent syst_perm_types record.  On INSERT or UPDATE when
such an syst_perm_type_degrees.ordering column collision is found, the system
will treat the operation as an "insert before" operation.  This means that the
newly inserted/updated record will have the requested ordering value and the
existing record with a colliding value will have its ordering value incremented
by one.  This also means that the newly inserted/updated record is considered to
have lesser authority relative the record it collided with.  Finally, the
reordering will cascade through other syst_perm_type_degrees records belonging
to the same parent syst_perm_types record using the same rule described above
until all records belonging to the syst_perm_types parent record have unique
ordering amongst their sibling records.$DOC$;
