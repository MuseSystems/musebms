    VIEW msbms_syst.syst_disallowed_passwords IS
$DOC$A list of hashed passwords which are disallowed for use in the system when the
password rule to disallow common/known compromised passwords is enabled.
Currently the expectation is that common passwords will be stored as sha1
hashes.

This API View allows the application to read and maintain the data according to
well defined application business rules.  Using this API view for updates to
data is the preferred method of data maintenance in the course of normal usage.

Only user maintainable values may be maintained via this API.  System created or
maintained data is not maintainable via this view.  Attempts at invalid data
maintenance via this API may result in the invalid changes being ignored or may
raise an exception.$DOC$;
