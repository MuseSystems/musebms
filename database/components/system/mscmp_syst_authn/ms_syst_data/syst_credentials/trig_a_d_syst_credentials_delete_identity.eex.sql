    -- Note that currently for all credential types which expect a

    -- delete the associated identity record.  If this assumption should change,
    -- such as if we should directly associate email identities with password
    -- credentials, this logic will need to consider the credential type since
    -- emails would not be deleted in all scenarios (passwords are recoverable).

COMMENT ON FUNCTION ms_syst_data.trig_a_d_syst_credentials_delete_identity() IS
$DOC$Deletes the syst_identities record associated with a newly deleted
syst_credentials record.

For those credential types that expect a relationship to syst_identities via the
syst_credentials.credential_for_identity_id column, the specific identifier and
credential data are closely related and updates to one or the other makes no
sense.  The correct process for updating such a pair is to delete both of the
existing identity and credential records and simply generate a new pair.
Deleting identity records achieves this goal via the constraint on the
credential_for_identity_id definition (ON DELETE CASCADE), but deleting a
credential has no automatic deletion feature thus this trigger.$DOC$;
