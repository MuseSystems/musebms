COMMENT ON
    VIEW msbms_syst.syst_global_password_rules IS
$DOC$Establishes a minimum standard for password credential complexity globally.
Individual Owners may define more restrictive complexity requirements for their
own accounts and instances, but may not weaken those defined globally.

This API View allows the application to read and maintain the data according to
well defined application business rules.  Using this API view for updates to
data is the preferred method of data maintenance in the course of normal usage.

Only user maintainable values may be maintained via this API.  System created or
maintained data is not maintainable via this view.  Attempts at invalid data
maintenance via this API may result in the invalid changes being ignored or may
raise an exception.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_global_password_rules.id IS
$DOC$The record's primary key.  The definitive identifier of the record in the
system.

This value is read only from this API view.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_global_password_rules.password_length IS
$DOC$An integer range of acceptable password lengths with the lower bound
representing the minimum length and the upper bound representing the maximum
password length.   Length is determined on a per character basis, not a per
byte basis.

A zero or negative value on either bound indicates that the bound check is
disabled.  Note that disabling a bound may still result in a bounds check using
the application defined default for the bound.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_global_password_rules.max_age IS
$DOC$An interval indicating the maximum allowed age of a password.  Any password
older than this interval will typically result in the user being forced to
update their password prior to being allowed access to other functionality. The
specific user workflow will depend on the implementation details of application.

An interval of 0 time disables the check and passwords may be of any age.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_global_password_rules.require_upper_case IS
$DOC$Establishes the minimum number of upper case characters that are required to be
present in the password.  Setting this value to 0 disables the requirement for
upper case characters.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_global_password_rules.require_lower_case IS
$DOC$Establishes the minimum number of lower case characters that are required to be
present in the password.  Setting this value to 0 disables the requirement for
lower case characters.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_global_password_rules.require_numbers IS
$DOC$Establishes the minimum number of numeric characters that are required to be
present in the password.  Setting this value to 0 disables the requirement for
numeric characters.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_global_password_rules.require_symbols IS
$DOC$Establishes the minimum number of non-alphanumeric characters that are required
to be present in the password.  Setting this value to 0 disables the requirement
for non-alphanumeric characters.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_global_password_rules.disallow_recently_used IS
$DOC$When passwords are changed, this value determines how many prior passwords
should be checked in order to prevent password re-use.  Setting this value to
zero or a negative number will disable the recently used password check.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_global_password_rules.disallow_compromised IS
$DOC$When true new passwords submitted through the change password process will be
checked against a list of common passwords and passwords known to have been
compromised and disallow their use as password credentials in the system.

When false submitted passwords are not checked as being common or against known
compromised passwords; such passwords would therefore be usable in the system.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_global_password_rules.require_mfa IS
$DOC$When true, an approved multi-factor authentication method must be used in
addition to the password credential.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_global_password_rules.allowed_mfa_types IS
$DOC$A array of the approved multi-factor authentication methods.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_global_password_rules.diag_timestamp_created IS
$DOC$The database server date/time when the transaction which created the record
started.

This value is read only from this API view.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_global_password_rules.diag_role_created IS
$DOC$The database role which created the record.

This value is read only from this API view.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_global_password_rules.diag_timestamp_modified IS
$DOC$The database server date/time when the transaction which modified the record
started.  This field will be the same as diag_timestamp_created for inserted
records.

This value is read only from this API view.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_global_password_rules.diag_wallclock_modified IS
$DOC$The database server date/time at the moment the record was actually modified.
For long running transactions this time may be significantly later than the
value of diag_timestamp_modified.

This value is read only from this API view.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_global_password_rules.diag_role_modified IS
$DOC$The database role which modified the record.

This value is read only from this API view.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_global_password_rules.diag_row_version IS
$DOC$The current version of the row.  The value here indicates how many actual
data changes have been made to the row.  If an update of the row leaves all data
fields the same, disregarding the updates to the diag_* columns, the row version
is not updated, nor are any updates made to the other diag_* columns other than
diag_update_count.

This value is read only from this API view.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_global_password_rules.diag_update_count IS
$DOC$Records the number of times the record has been updated regardless as to if
the update actually changed any data.  In this way needless or redundant record
updates can be found.  This row starts at 0 and therefore may be the same as the
diag_row_version - 1.

This value is read only from this API view.$DOC$;
