COMMENT ON
    TABLE msbms_syst_data.syst_disallowed_passwords IS
$DOC$A list of hashed passwords which are disallowed for use in the system when the
password rule to disallow common/known compromised passwords is enabled.
Currently the expectation is that common passwords will be stored as sha1
hashes.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst_data.syst_disallowed_passwords.password_hash IS
$DOC$The SHA1 hash of the disallowed password.  The reason for using SHA1 here is
that it is compatible with the "Have I Been Pwned" data and API products.  We
also get some reasonable obscuring of possibly private data.$DOC$;
