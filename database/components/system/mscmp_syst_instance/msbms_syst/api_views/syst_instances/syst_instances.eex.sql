COMMENT ON
    VIEW msbms_syst.syst_instances IS
$DOC$Defines known application instances and provides their configuration settings.

This API View allows the application to read and maintain the data according to
well defined application business rules.  Using this API view for updates to
data is the preferred method of data maintenance in the course of normal usage.

Only user maintainable values may be maintained via this API.  System created or
maintained data is not maintainable via this view.  Attempts at invalid data
maintenance via this API may result in the invalid changes being ignored or may
raise an exception.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instances.id IS
$DOC$The record's primary key.  The definitive identifier of the record in the
system.

This value may not be updated via this API view.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instances.internal_name IS
$DOC$A candidate key useful for programmatic references to individual records.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instances.display_name IS
$DOC$A friendly name and candidate key for the record, suitable for use in user
interactions$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instances.application_id IS
$DOC$Indicates an instance of which application is being described by the record.

Once set, this value may may not be updated via this API view later.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instances.instance_type_id IS
$DOC$Indicates the type of the instance.  This can designate instances as being
production or non-production, or make other functional differences between
instances created for different reasons based on the assigned instance type.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instances.instance_state_id IS
$DOC$Establishes the current life-cycle state of the instance record.  This can
determine functionality such as if the instance is usable, visible, or if it may
be purged from the database completely.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instances.owner_id IS
$DOC$Identifies the owner of the instance.  The owner is the entity which
commissioned the instance and is the "user" of the instance.  Owners have
nominal management rights over their instances, such as which access accounts
and which credential types are allowed to be used to authenticate to the owner's
instances.

Once set, this value may not be updated via this API view.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instances.owning_instance_id IS
$DOC$In some cases, an instance is considered subordinate to another instance.  For
example, consider a production environment and a related sandbox environment.
The existence of the sandbox doesn't have real meaning without being associated
with some sort of production instance where the real work is performed.  This
kind of association becomes clearer in SaaS environments where a primary
instance is contracted for, but other supporting instances, such as a sandbox,
should follow certain account related actions of the primary.

Once set, this value may not be updated via this API view.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instances.dbserver_name IS
$DOC$Identifies on which database server the instance is hosted. If empty, no
server has been assigned and the instance is unstartable.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instances.instance_code IS
$DOC$This is a random sequence of bytes intended for use in certain algorithmic
credential generation.  Note that losing this value may prevent the Instance
from being started due to bad credentials; there may be other consequences as
well.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instances.instance_options IS
$DOC$A key/value store of values which define application or instance specific
options.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instances.diag_timestamp_created IS
$DOC$The database server date/time when the transaction which created the record
started.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instances.diag_role_created IS
$DOC$The database role which created the record.

This value is read only from this API view.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instances.diag_timestamp_modified IS
$DOC$The database server date/time when the transaction which modified the record
started.  This field will be the same as diag_timestamp_created for inserted
records.

This value is read only from this API view.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instances.diag_wallclock_modified IS
$DOC$The database server date/time at the moment the record was actually modified.
For long running transactions this time may be significantly later than the
value of diag_timestamp_modified.

This value is read only from this API view.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instances.diag_role_modified IS
$DOC$The database role which modified the record.

This value is read only from this API view.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instances.diag_row_version IS
$DOC$The current version of the row.  The value here indicates how many actual
data changes have been made to the row.  If an update of the row leaves all data
fields the same, disregarding the updates to the diag_* columns, the row version
is not updated, nor are any updates made to the other diag_* columns other than
diag_update_count.

This value is read only from this API view.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instances.diag_update_count IS
$DOC$Records the number of times the record has been updated regardless as to if
the update actually changed any data.  In this way needless or redundant record
updates can be found.  This row starts at 0 and therefore may be the same as the
diag_row_version - 1.

This value is read only from this API view.$DOC$;
