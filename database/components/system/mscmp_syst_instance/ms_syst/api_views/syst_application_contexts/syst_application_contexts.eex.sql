COMMENT ON
    VIEW ms_syst.syst_application_contexts IS
$DOC$Applications are written with certain security and connection
characteristics in mind which correlate to database roles used by the
application for establishing connections.  This table defines the datastore
contexts the application is expecting so that Instance records can be validated
against the expectations.

This API View allows the application to read and maintain the data according to
well defined application business rules.  Using this API view for updates to
data is the preferred method of data maintenance in the course of normal usage.

Only user maintainable values may be maintained via this API.  System created or
maintained data is not maintainable via this view.  Attempts at invalid data
maintenance via this API may result in the invalid changes being ignored or may
raise an exception.$DOC$;
