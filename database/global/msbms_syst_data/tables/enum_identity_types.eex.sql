COMMENT ON
    TABLE msbms_syst_data.enum_identity_types IS
$DOC$The various kinds of identity that can be used to identify a user to the system.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst_data.enum_identity_types.id IS
$DOC$The record's primary key.  The definitive identifier of the record in the
system.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst_data.enum_identity_types.internal_name IS
$DOC$A candidate key useful for programmatic references to individual records.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst_data.enum_identity_types.display_name IS
$DOC$A friendly name and candidate key for the record, suitable for use in user
identitys.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN  msbms_syst_data.enum_identity_types.functional_type IS
$DOC$Establishes what system recognized type the type represents.  Functional types
may determine how the system behaves in certain circumstances.  Functional types
recognized by this application:

    * user_name:  This identity type indicates the sort of user name a human
                  user would enter into a login form to identify themselves.
                  Typically this will be an email address.  This identity may
                  only be used for interactive logins and explicitly not for
                  in scenarios where you would use token credential types for
                  authentication.

    * account_id: Account IDs are system generated IDs which can be used
                  similar to user name, but can be given to third parties, such
                  as the administrator of an application instance for the
                  purpose of being granted user access to the instance, without
                  also disclosing personal ID information such as an email
                  address.  These IDs are typical simple and easy to provide via
                  verbal or written communication.  This ID type is not allowed
                  for login.

    * api_id:     A system generated ID for use in identifying the user account
                  in automated access scenarios.  This kind of ID differs from
                  the account_id in that it is significantly larger than an
                  account ID would be and may only be used with token
                  credential types.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst_data.enum_identity_types.description IS
$DOC$A text describing the meaning and use of the specific record that may be
visible to users of the record.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst_data.enum_identity_types.options IS
$DOC$A JSON representation of various behaviorial options that the application may
make when the enum is assigned to the record it is qualifying.  Options may
include flags, rules to test, and other such arbitrary behaviors as required by
the specific record to which the enum is assigned.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst_data.enum_identity_types.user_options IS
$DOC$Allows for user defined options related to the type similar to the way the
options field is envisioned.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst_data.enum_identity_types.diag_timestamp_created IS
$DOC$The database server date/time when the transaction which created the record
started.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst_data.enum_identity_types.diag_role_created IS
$DOC$The database role which created the record.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst_data.enum_identity_types.diag_timestamp_modified IS
$DOC$The database server date/time when the transaction which modified the record
started.  This field will be the same as diag_timestamp_created for inserted
records.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst_data.enum_identity_types.diag_wallclock_modified IS
$DOC$The database server date/time at the moment the record was actually modified.
For long running transactions this time may be significantly later than the
value of diag_timestamp_modified.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst_data.enum_identity_types.diag_role_modified IS
$DOC$The database role which modified the record.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst_data.enum_identity_types.diag_row_version IS
$DOC$The current version of the row.  The value here indicates how many actual
data changes have been made to the row.  If an update of the row leaves all data
fields the same, disregarding the updates to the diag_* columns, the row version
is not updated, nor are any updates made to the other diag_* columns other than
diag_update_count.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst_data.enum_identity_types.diag_update_count IS
$DOC$Records the number of times the record has been updated regardless as to if
the update actually changed any data.  In this way needless or redundant record
updates can be found.  This row starts at 0 and therefore may be the same as the
diag_row_version - 1.$DOC$;
