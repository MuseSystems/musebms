COMMENT ON
    VIEW msbms_syst.syst_instance_contexts IS
$DOC$Instance specific settings which determine how each Instance connects to the
defined Application Contexts.

This API View allows the application to read and maintain the data according to
well defined application business rules.  Using this API view for updates to
data is the preferred method of data maintenance in the course of normal usage.

Only user maintainable values may be maintained via this API.  System created or
maintained data is not maintainable via this view.  Attempts at invalid data
maintenance via this API may result in the invalid changes being ignored or may
raise an exception.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instance_contexts.id IS
$DOC$The record's primary key.  The definitive identifier of the record in the
system.

This column is read only and not maintainable via this API view.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instance_contexts.internal_name IS
$DOC$A candidate key useful for programmatic references to individual records.

This column's value must be set on INSERT, but may not be updated later using
this API view.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instance_contexts.display_name IS
$DOC$A friendly name and candidate key for the record, suitable for use in user
interactions$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instance_contexts.instance_id IS
$DOC$Identifies the parent Instance for which Instance Contexts are being defined.

This column's value must be set on INSERT, but may not be updated later using
this API view.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instance_contexts.application_context_id IS
$DOC$Identifies the Application Context which is being defined for the Instance.

This column's value must be set on INSERT, but may not be updated later using
this API view.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instance_contexts.start_context IS
$DOC$If true, indicates that the Instance Context should be started, so long as the
Application Context record is also set to allow context starting.  If false, the
Instance Context not be started, even if the related Application Context is set
to allow context starts.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instance_contexts.db_pool_size IS
$DOC$If the Application Context is a login datastore context, this value establishes
how many database connections to open on behalf of this Instance Context.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instance_contexts.context_code IS
$DOC$An Instance Context specific series of bytes which are used in algorithmic
credential generation.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instance_contexts.diag_timestamp_created IS
$DOC$The database server date/time when the transaction which created the record
started.

This column is read only and not maintainable via this API view.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instance_contexts.diag_role_created IS
$DOC$The database role which created the record.

This column is read only and not maintainable via this API view.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instance_contexts.diag_timestamp_modified IS
$DOC$The database server date/time when the transaction which modified the record
started.  This field will be the same as diag_timestamp_created for inserted
records.

This column is read only and not maintainable via this API view.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instance_contexts.diag_wallclock_modified IS
$DOC$The database server date/time at the moment the record was actually modified.
For long running transactions this time may be significantly later than the
value of diag_timestamp_modified.

This column is read only and not maintainable via this API view.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instance_contexts.diag_role_modified IS
$DOC$The database role which modified the record.

This column is read only and not maintainable via this API view.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instance_contexts.diag_row_version IS
$DOC$The current version of the row.  The value here indicates how many actual
data changes have been made to the row.  If an update of the row leaves all data
fields the same, disregarding the updates to the diag_* columns, the row version
is not updated, nor are any updates made to the other diag_* columns other than
diag_update_count.

This column is read only and not maintainable via this API view.$DOC$;

COMMENT ON
    COLUMN msbms_syst.syst_instance_contexts.diag_update_count IS
$DOC$Records the number of times the record has been updated regardless as to if
the update actually changed any data.  In this way needless or redundant record
updates can be found.  This row starts at 0 and therefore may be the same as the
diag_row_version - 1.

This column is read only and not maintainable via this API view.$DOC$;
