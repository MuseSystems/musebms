## General

While it might seem obvious what a "Person" is, we're going to augment that assumable definition a
bit here.  A Person, for our purposes, is someone who acts as an agent on behalf of an entity; the
designated contact for any communications regarding some aspect of business that the Entity may
engage in.

## Person as Functional Designation

A Person will often times be a named individual in the real world, but there will be
times where a Person represents a role that might be fulfilled by any of a group of people; for
example, an "Accounts Payable" Person representing a vendor might mean that any one of the
vendor's Accounts Payable staff may act as the accounts payable agent during a discussion of
invoicing or payment.  In such a case the specific individual doesn't matter.

## Contact

"Contact", as we use the term here, refers specifically to how a Person is contacted. This can
include designating email addresses, telephone numbers, messaging application IDs, and physical
 addresses such as mailing addresses as being means by with to contact a Person.

The term "Contact" in a number of business systems is a synonym for our term "Person".

In our concepts, however, these are separate and distinct ideas which should not be conflated.

Any one Person may have a variety of different applicable Contact methods, though typically there
will be preferred or default methods of contact.
