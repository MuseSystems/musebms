For our purposes, a Relationship describes how any two Entities/People/Places interact with each
other during the conduct of business or for which recognition of the Relationship can aid in
performing analysis of business data.

Many of the Relationships described below imply a rich set of information associated with the
Relationship and which defines it.  As a case in point, to fully understand a Sales Relationship
you must understand the payment terms, the ordering rules, credit limits, etc. upon which the
Sales Relationship is predicated.

Most Relationships we define will be directional.  For example in a Sales Relationship between
two Entities, the first party Entity will be the seller and the external Entity is the customer.
The existence of that Relationship does not imply that the Sales Relationship is reversible.  If
both Entities sold products/services to each other, a Purchasing Relationship where the first
party Entity was the buyer and the external Entity was the vendor would need to be created to
represent the bi-directional nature of the overall relationship.

Other Relationships, however are simple and can be sufficiently understood by merely acknowledging
that the relationship exists at all.  Often times we will refer to these Relationships as "Roles".
