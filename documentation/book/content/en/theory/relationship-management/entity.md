An Entity can be any organization, company, government, or individual which can legally enter into
a contract and with whom business is transacted.

Ideally, each relevant real world Entity will be represented in a business system by a single
record and all transactions to which that Entity is party are ultimately linked to that record.

Throughout the Business Relationships section we'll be referring to different Entities from the
perspective of one working within a specific company or organization.  A "first party Entity" or
"primary Entity" therefore would be our company or organization and an "external Entity", "second
party Entity", or "third party Entity" would be some other Entity from our assumed perspective.
When we speak in terms of business systems, the first party Entity will be the one whose staff
would be using the system.
