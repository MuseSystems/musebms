## Introduction

In his 1985 paper entitled <a href="https://pablo.rauzy.name/dev/naur1985programming.pdf" target="_blank">"Programming as Theory Building"</a>, renowned computer scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Naur" target="_blank">Peter Naur</a> argued that you cannot truly understand what a computer program does by merely looking at the source code of the program.  In Naur's view the program is merely an implementation of a deeper set of axioms, beliefs, and understandings... a theory... which is more deeply held by the programmer.  To understand the program, you have to understand the thinking of the programmer, who in turn is informed by externalities which provide the impetus to create the program in the first place.

This section of documentation attempts to capture the axioms, beliefs, and understandings motivating the implementation of the Muse Systems Business Management System.  This content should not be viewed as necessarily establishing functional requirements or specific implementation plans, though such project artifacts will express the ideas written in this section as tempered by practical reality.  In addition to establishing a "theory" for our system, we also hope to provide learning materials for those that might work with this system who might not have an extensive background in working with this class of business systems.

Finally ideas presented here should not be considered a formally researched collection of business system implementation practices.  These ideas originate in the practical, real world experiences of the author.  As such they are anecdotally motivated.  This isn't to say no research was conducted to develop the ideas here, but that the research would not likely be considered academically rigorous. The focus here is on developing a working, practical model for a system used by a real business rather than trying to develop a survey for academics reading about business.
