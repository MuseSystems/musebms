## Introduction

In his 1985 paper entitled <a href="https://pablo.rauzy.name/dev/naur1985programming.pdf" target="_blank">"Programming as Theory Building"</a>,
renowned computer scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Naur" target="_blank">Peter Naur</a>
argued that you cannot truly understand what a computer program does by merely looking at the
source code of the program.  In Naur's view the program is merely an implementation of a deeper
set of axioms, beliefs, and understandings... a theory... which is more deeply held directly by
the programmer.  To understand the program, you have to understand the thinking of the programmer,
who in turn is informed by externalities which provide the impetus to create the program in the
first place.

This section of documentation attempts to capture the axioms, beliefs, and understandings
motivating the implementation of the Muse Systems Business Management System.  This content should
not be viewed as necessarily establishing functional requirements or specific implementation
plans, though such project artifacts will express the ideas written in this section as tempered by
practical reality.  In addition to establishing a "theory" for our system, we also hope to provide
learning materials for those that might work with this system who might not have an extensive
background in working with this class of business systems.

Most business system documentation is organized along the lines of typical business operations and
departmental structures, however our organization of topics in this discussion of theory departs
from these conventions.  Because we're dealing with these topics on a conceptual level rather than
an operational level we're organizing our content along these conceptual boundaries.  Naturally
systems design and documentation dealing with the daily use of these systems is best organized in
the traditional, operationally focused way.

Finally ideas presented here should not be considered a formally researched collection of business
system implementation practices.  These ideas originate in the practical, real world experiences
of the author.  As such they are anecdotally motivated.  This isn't to say no research was
conducted or that practical experience cannot lead to useful knowledge, but that the information
in this documentation would not be considered academically rigorous. The focus here is on
developing a working, practical model for a system used by real businesses rather than trying to
write a paper for academic consumption.
