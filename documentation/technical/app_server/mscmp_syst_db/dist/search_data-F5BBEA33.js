In the model\nimplemented here, the developer creates source files in PL/pgSQL and then\nupdates a build plans file which determines how the individual source files\nare copied into individual migration files which will then be deployed to the\ndatabase.  This allows the developer to treat database source more closely to\nnon-database source code, at least during initial database development.\n\nThis migrations model allows for creation of multiple, different databases for\napplications that require more than a single database definition.  These\nmultiple database definitions are referred to as _*database types*_.\n\nThis build process expects the source files to be kept within an independent\nsource directory, by default: `database` of the project root.  In addition to\nthe source files, the database directory should also contain TOML files named\n`buildplans. .toml` which define what migrations will be built\nand in what order the database source files will be copied to them.  Each\ndatabase type will have its own TOML build plans file.\n\nThe build plan file is a TOML file with an array of tables of `[[buildplan]]`:\n```toml\n[[build_plan]]\nrelease              = 1\nversion              = 1\nupdate               = 0\nsponsor              = 820\nsponsor_modification = 0\nload_files = [\n    \"tables/table_one.sql\",\n    {type = \"sql\", file = \"tables/table_two.sql\"},\n    {type = \"plan\", file = \"subplans/subplans.component.toml\"}\n]\n```\nThe fields above are defined as:\n\n  * `release` - The major version number of the migration.  The first element\n    of the migration file name.\n\n\n  * `version` - The minor version number of the migration.  The second element\n    of the migration file name.\n\n\n  * `update` - The patch version number of the migration.  The third element\n    of the migration name.\n\n\n  * `sponsor` - In cases where specific clients that use the software are able\n    to sponsor client-specific customizations, this field identifies the\n    client sponsoring the change.  This element is the fourth element of the\n    migration file name.  All sponsor numbers in the range 0 - 1295 are\n    reserved for Muse Systems internal use and some specific values in that\n    range currently have assigned meanings.  General public software releases\n    from Muse Systems will have a sponsor value of `820` (`MS` in Base 36),\n    software versions including sponsor number `821` (`MT` in Base 36)\n    indicate software created for internal, development testing purposes which\n    should never be part of a public release of the software.\n\n  * `sponsor_modification` - This field allows for sponsored customization to\n    both be versioned and sequenced in the migration process.  This is the\n    fifth element of the migration name.  For non-sponsored migrations, this\n    field should just be left at zero.\n\n\n  * `load_files` - A list of SQL files and sub-plans to include in the build.\n    Collectively, these are \"Load File Items\".\n\nEach Load File Item may take one of three forms:\n\n  1. `\"path/to/file.sql\"` - A simple string is interpreted as the path to an\n     SQL file to load into a migration.\n\n  2. `{type = \"sql\", file = \"path/to/file.sql\"}` - This is the same as the\n     simple file path of form 1.  Using this form could allow for a slightly\n     cleaner representation if sat in a group of sub-plan Load File Items.\n\n  3. `{type = \"plan\", file = \"path/to/subplan.toml\"}` - In this form the path\n     indicates that the file is a nested build plan, or sub-plan, whose\n     directives should be followed at this location.  A sub-plan is itself a\n     normal build plan.  By convention, a sub-plan file name should take the\n     form: `subplans. .toml`; unlike the build plan naming\n     convention, following the sub-plan naming convention is not required.\n     While build plans may be nested arbitrarily deep, a best practice is to\n     only use a single level of nesting.\n\nEach table in the array is a specific build plan which will build a single\nmigration.  The body of the migration itself is simply the files in the\n`load_files` list copied to the migration file in the order of the list.  Note\nthat the migration code is wrapped in a PostgreSQL `DO` block (PL/pgSQL) so\nsource files may use all the capabilities of PostgreSQL anonymous blocks as\nare they subject to its limitations.\n\nLater, on deployment, the migrations will be applied in migration name order.\nThe migration name is constructed from the versioning information in the\n`buildplan` table with each of the versioning fields (recorded as integers)\nbeing added in their zero padded, base-36 representations.","ref":"Mix.Tasks.Builddb.html#module-description"},{"type":"function","title":"Mix.Tasks.Builddb.run/1","doc":"","ref":"Mix.Tasks.Builddb.html#run/1"},{"type":"task","title":"mix dropdb","doc":"Drops a previously loaded development supporting Datastore.\n\nThis command takes a number of options many of which match `Mix.Tasks.Loaddb`.\nInsofar as they have corresponding options, the options used with this Mix\ntask should have values which match the command used to create the Datastore;\nfailing to do this could cause the drop operation to fail or fail partially.\n\n>##","ref":"Mix.Tasks.Dropdb.html"},{"type":"task","title":"Usage Note {: .warning} - mix dropdb","doc":">\n> There is nothing stopping you from using this command from dropping any\n> Datastore in the system and technically it should work.

Datastore Contexts are specific to a single Datastore and are managed\nby the this Component, including the creation, maintenance, and dropping of them\nas needed, typically in conjunction with Datastore creation/deletion.\n\nBehind the scenes Datastore Contexts use the [\"Ecto Dynamic Repositories\"](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/replicas-and-dynamic-repositories.html#dynamic-repositories) feature.\nEach Datastore Context is backed by an Ecto Dynamic Repo.   Starting a Datastore\nContext starts its Ecto Dynamic Repo including establishing the connections to\nthe database.  Stopping a Datastore Context shuts that associated Dynamic Repo\ndown and terminates its database connections.\n\nThere are several different kinds of Datastore Contexts which can be defined:\n\n  * __Owner__: This kind of Datastore Context creates a database role to serve\n    as the database owner of all the database objects backing the Datastore\n    making it the de facto admin role for the Datastore.  While the Owner\n    Datastore Context owns the database objects backing the Datastore, it is\n    only a regular database role (no special database rights) and it cannot be a\n    database login role itself.  All Datastores must have exactly one Owner\n    Datastore Context defined.\n\n  * __Login__: The Login Datastore Context is a regular database role with which\n    the application can log into the database and perform operations allowed by\n    the database security policies established by the database developer.  There\n    can be one or more Login Datastore Contexts in order to support various\n    security profiles that the application may assume or in order to build\n    connection pools with varying limits depending on some application specific\n    need (e.g. connections support web user interface vs. connections supporting\n    external API interactions.).  For a Datastore to be useful there must be at\n    least one Login Datastore Context defined for the Datastore.\n\n  * __Non-Login__: While the Owner Datastore Context is required, there are\n    other possible scenarios where non-login roles could be useful in managing\n    access to specific database objects, but how useful Non-Login roles might\n    be will depend on application specific factors; the expectation is that\n    their use will be rare.  Naturally, there is no requirement for Non-Login\n    Datastore Contexts to be defined for any Datastore.\n\nFinally, when we access the database from the application we'll always be doing\nso identifying one of our Login Datastore Contexts.  This is done using\n`MscmpSystDb.put_datastore_context/1` which behind the scenes is using the\n`Ecto.Repo` dynamic repository features (`c:Ecto.Repo.put_dynamic_repo/1`).\nNote that there is no default Ecto Repo, dynamic or otherwise, defined in the\nsystem.  Any attempts to access a Datastore Context without having established\nthe current Datastore Context for the process will cause the process to crash.\n\n>##","ref":"MscmpSystDb.html#module-datastore-context"},{"type":"module","title":"Warning! {: .warning} - MscmpSystDb","doc":">\n> Datastore Contexts are created and destroyed by the application using the API\n> functions in this Component.

This Component separates the two concepts:\n\n  * Database source code files are written by the developer as the developer\n    sees fit.  Database source files are what we are most concerned with from a\n    source control perspective; and these files can be freely modified and\n    changes committed up to the point that they are built into released\n    migrations.  Database source files are written in (mostly) plain SQL; `EEx`\n    tags are allowed in the SQL and can be bound during migration time.\n\n  * Once the database source code has reached some stage of completion, the\n    developer can use the `mix builddb` task to generate migration files from\n    the database sources.  In order to build the migration files, the developer\n    will create a `TOML` \"build plan\" file which indicates which database source\n    files to include in the migrations and their sequence.  For more about the\n    build process and build plans see the `mix builddb` task documentation.\n\nNow let's connect this back to the development phases discussed previously.\nDuring the \"Initial/Major Development\" phase, we expect that there will be many\ndatabase source files and that these files will be written, committed to source\ncontrol, modified, and re-committed to source control not as migrations but as\nyou would any other source file (for example, maybe one file per table.); we\nmight also be building migration files at this time for testing purposes, but\nuntil the application is released we'd expect the migration files to be cleaned\nout and rebuilt.  Finally once tests, code, reviews, etc. are complete and a\nrelease is ready to be prepared, a final `mix builddb` is run to create the\nrelease migrations and those migrations are committed to source control.\n\nFrom this point forward we generally wouldn't modify the original database\nsource files or the final release migrations: the release migrations are\nessentially set in stone once they may be deployed to a environment where\ndropping the database is not an option.  Subsequent development in the \"Ongoing\nMaintenance\" phase looks similar to traditional migration development.  For any\nmodification to the database you'll create new a database source file(s) for\nthose modifications specifically and they'll get new version numbers which will\nin turn create new migrations when `mix builddb` builds them.  These will then\nbe deployed to the database as standard migrations would.","ref":"MscmpSystDb.html#module-source-files-building-migrations-overview"},{"type":"module","title":"Migration Deployments - MscmpSystDb","doc":"Once built, migration files are deployed to a database similar to the way\ntraditional migration systems perform their deployments: the migrations are\nchecked, in migration number order, against a special database table listing the\npreviously deployed migrations (table `ms_syst_db.migrations`).  If a migration\nhas been previously deployed, it's skipped and the deployment process moves onto\nthe next migration; if the migration needs to be deployed it is applied to the\ndatabase and, assuming successful deployment, the process moves onto the next\nmigration or exits when all outstanding migrations have been applied.\n\nEach individual migration is applied in a single database transaction.  This\nmeans that if part of a migration fails to apply to the database successfully,\nthe entire migration is rolled back and the database will be in the state of the\nlast fully successful migration application.  A migration application failure\nwill abort the migration process, cancelling the attempted application of\nmigrations after the failed migration.\n\nUnlike the `EctoSql` based migration process, migrations in `MscmpSystDb` are\nexpected to be managed at runtime by the application.  There is no external\n`mix` oriented migration deployment process.  Migration processes are started\nfor each tenant database individually allowing for selective application of\nmigrations to the specified environment or allowing for \"upgrade window\" style\nfunctionality.  Migrations are also `EEx` templates and template bindings can be\nsupplied to the migrator to make each deployment specific to the database being\nmigrated if appropriate.   Naturally, much depends on the broader application\ndesign, but the migrator can support a number of different scenarios for\ndeployment of database changes.\n\nFinally, the migrator, can in a single application, manage and migrate different\ndatabase schemas/migration sets depending on the identified \"type\".  This means\nthat different database schemas for different subsystems can be supported by the\nmigration system in a single application.  This assumes that a single database\nis of a single type; that type may be any of the available types, but mixing of\ntypes in a single database is not allowed.","ref":"MscmpSystDb.html#module-migration-deployments"},{"type":"module","title":"Custom Database Types - MscmpSystDb","doc":"`Ecto`, `EctoSql`, and the underlying PostgreSQL library `Postgrex` offer decent\nPostgreSQL data type support out of box, but they don't directly map some of the\ndatabase types that can be helpful in business software such as PostgreSQL range\ntypes, internet address types, and interval types.
