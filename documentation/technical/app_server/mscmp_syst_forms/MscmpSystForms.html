  <a href="#module-foundational-ideas">
    <i class="ri-link-m" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    Foundational Ideas
  </a>
</h2>
<p>At the heart of our methodology and support are several key ideas presented
here.</p><blockquote><h4 class="neutral">On &quot;Forms&quot;</h4><p>One thing to be mindful of as you read this section and the documentation
generally is our use of the word &quot;Form&quot;.  In this documentation we will more
often use the word &quot;Form&quot; in the more generic sense of a user interface to a
particular subject or feature than to refer to a specific Form Component
or something like an HTML form; we will use the word in that manner as well and
hopefully context should make clear which sense we mean.</p></blockquote><h4>Definitions vs. Rendering</h4><p>A &quot;Form&quot; conforming to the <a href="MscmpSystForms.html#content"><code class="inline">MscmpSystForms</code></a> standard will be defined in two
distinct parts:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Definitional Concerns</strong></p><p>Our forms may be complex and include a variety of both informational and
input fields (elements) to which different users will have different
permission based entitlements.  Additionally, some element properties, such
as labels, may appear not just along side the element in the user interface
but also in tool tips, quick help pages and the like. Some properties, such
as permissions or even some runtime display properties can easily be made
inheritable from parent elements to child elements; naturally, the idea of
virtual elements can be useful in building such hierarchies as well.</p><p>Having a place to define both these static elements and the inheritance
hierarchies between elements without necessarily being coupled to the layout
has advantages.  We can create a cleaner definition of these properties
while reducing the redundancies that defining these attributes in the
context of page layout concerns could force on us as well as reducing the
noise that display related attributes would necessarily force on us.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rendering Concerns</strong></p><p>All forms must ultimately be laid out for rendering as the user interface
and this area of concern deals with the issues of laying out our form
elements.</p></li></ul><p>The truth is that the &quot;Rendering Concerns&quot; are really the typical user interface
development activities (web or otherwise) that most front end developers will
think about and it is the &quot;Definitional Concerns&quot; which we are adding to that
process.</p><h4>Form Data</h4><p>It is not uncommon to closely couple database Ecto schema definitions with the
presentation and management forms, using the Ecto database schema to directly
drive the user interface forms.  The problem is that it can force unnatural
compromises to either the database structure (assuming that the Ecto Schemas are
representative of the underlying table structures) or the user interface forms
or both.</p><p>In our model we view both the database structure and the user interface design
as first class concerns and as such our standard is to not directly use Ecto
Schemas which define database data to also back forms.  We create independent
Ecto <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/embedded-schemas.html">&quot;Embedded Schemas&quot;</a> to back
the forms specifically.  It absolutely happens that there can be form schemas
and database schemas with high degrees of similarity, but by setting the
expectation that we will always have an Embedded Schema defined to back the form
ensures that the development of the form avoids the aforementioned conflicts and
compromises.</p><p>Any given form will also have three senses of its data, each of which may differ
from each other enough that we track the data for all three purposes:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Original Data</strong></p><p>This is the data which a form initializes with.  When creating new records,
this will either be empty or populated with the default values defined as
the starting place for any new records.  For viewing or editing existing
data records, this value will be the data as loaded from the database.  As
the user interacts with the form, these original data values will not
change, always reflecting the starting point with which the form was
initialized.</p><p>While not always useful we can use the original data for fallback/reset
purposes, to display changes (e.g. percentage changed) relative to the
starting data, and similar such purposes.</p><p>In the form's assigns we represent this using the form backing <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/3.10.3/Ecto.html"><code class="inline">Ecto</code></a>
embedded schema struct which can be passed as the &quot;data&quot; expected by
<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/3.10.3/Ecto.Changeset.html"><code class="inline">Ecto.Changeset</code></a> validation functions.  This data is kept by the view
including all values regardless of user permissions to see or alter those
values.</p></li><li><p><strong>Current Data</strong></p><p>The current state of the data, including any changes made by the user or
system as they interact with the form, but prior to those changes being
committed to the database.  The starting point of this data when the form
initializes is typically the same as the Original Data.</p><p>As the user interacts with the form, the current data is updated to reflect
changes.  We usually store this data in the form's assigns as a map as we
can pass this directly to the data validation functions (<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/3.10.3/Ecto.Changeset.html"><code class="inline">Ecto.Changeset</code></a>
based) as needed.</p><p>The current data includes all form data regardless of the user's permissions
to view or edit that data.</p></li><li><p><strong>Display Data</strong></p><p>A representation of the data for the purposes of display to the user in the
form.  The data values in Display Data are the same as those in Current Data
except they are filtered by the user's permissions for data visibility.</p><p>Display Data is stored in the view's assigns as a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_html/3.3.2/Phoenix.HTML.Form.html#t:t/0"><code class="inline">Phoenix.HTML.Form.t/0</code></a>
struct so that it can be accessed directly by the LiveView for rendering.</p></li></ul><h4>Working with Phoenix</h4><p>The most common use case for <a href="MscmpSystForms.html#content"><code class="inline">MscmpSystForms</code></a> is for facilitating Phoenix based
web and external API user interface development.  To understand how
<a href="MscmpSystForms.html#content"><code class="inline">MscmpSystForms</code></a> fits into the Phoenix development model it's important to
understand certain assumptions we make about the role of Phoenix in our broader
application development paradigm.</p><blockquote><h4 class="warning">Important</h4><p>Our thinking and approach to working with Phoenix is not the conventional or
generally accepted approach in many ways.  Use caution and understand the
trade-offs when evaluating our work in this regard.</p></blockquote><p>Our development model takes the stance that Phoenix is not the application, but
the user interface layer.  That layer brings together a lot of dependencies to
deliver services, but those dependencies are independently developed as separate
Elixir/OTP applications and could be used (in theory) in other contexts.</p><p>As such our Phoenix application only deals with the presentation of the user
interface and wiring that user interface to the actual business/domain logic
written elsewhere.  In the process some elements which by convention has certain
roles within typical Phoenix application development are repurposed to serve our
needs better.</p><h2 id="module-developing-forms" class="section-heading">

    Developing Forms
  </a>
</h2>
<p>With our Foundational Ideas having been discussed, we now move on to looking how
this translates into form development.</p><h4>Source Organization &amp; File Roles</h4><p>Starting with a standard Phoenix application, to which <a href="MscmpSystForms.html#content"><code class="inline">MscmpSystForms</code></a> has been
added as a dependency, we will have two basic directories (or applications in
the case where the Phoenix project is initialized as an umbrella project):
<code class="inline">my_app</code>, <code class="inline">my_app_web</code>.  In typical Phoenix applications the web based user
interface including views and controllers are built in the <code class="inline">my_app_web</code>
directory and the business/domain logic (i.e. &quot;contexts&quot;)  resides in the
<code class="inline">my_app</code> directory.  We adopt the directories created by <code class="inline">mix phx.new</code>, but we
change their purpose:</p><ul><li><p><strong>my_app_web</strong></p><p>Hosts view related code.  Controller like code is discouraged here.</p></li><li><p><strong>my_app</strong>:</p><p>Hosts controller like logic.  Business/Domain Logic is discouraged here and
should be developed in external Elixir Projects and included as dependencies
in the Phoenix application.</p></li></ul><p>Using these directories, and assuming our application has one form (<code class="inline">my_form</code>),
we will create the following basic file structure for our form's source code:</p><pre><code class="makeup elixir" translate="no"><span class="n">my_app_web</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="err">└</span><span class="err">─</span><span class="err">─</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">lib</span><span class="w">

entries important to understanding the <a href="MscmpSystForms.html#content"><code class="inline">MscmpSystForms</code></a> development model.
Other files and directories which are standard for Phoenix development and
which would be present but unaltered under our model have been excluded from
the example listings.</p></blockquote><ul><li><p><strong>my_app_web</strong></p><p>In the <code class="inline">my_app_web</code> example listing the path <code class="inline">my_app_web/lib/my_app_web/live</code>
is the standard Phoenix pathing for <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/0.19.5/Phoenix.LiveView.html"><code class="inline">Phoenix.LiveView</code></a> pages.  While we do
make some assumption changes to Phoenix standard practices in regard to what
gets done in this directory, those changes are minor and really a matter of
convention.</p><h4>Files</h4><ul><li><p><code class="inline">my_form_live.html.heex</code></p><p>this file is a typical Phoenix LiveView <code class="inline">Heex</code> file.  The only difference
from standard Phoenix Heex development is that
<a href="MscmpSystForms.WebComponents.html"><code class="inline">MscmpSystForms.WebComponents</code></a> will be used as a source of components
rather than the <code class="inline">CoreComponents</code> module which comes with Phoenix (though
it is available).</p></li><li><p><code class="inline">my_form_live.ex</code></p><p>this file is the typical LiveView controller file
which backs the LiveView which is home to the LiveView's <code class="inline">mount/3</code>,
<code class="inline">handle_event/3</code>, and <code class="inline">handle_info/2</code> functions.  The difference under the
<a href="MscmpSystForms.html#content"><code class="inline">MscmpSystForms</code></a> model is that we typically code much less logic directly
in this file allowing that logic to exist in the <code class="inline">my_app</code> directory
hierarchy.</p><p>Therefore this file is limited to two roles: 1) mapping LiveView events to
controller level logic in the <code class="inline">my_app</code> code; and 2) values which directly
become display issues in the web interface; for example text strings for
flash messages related to validation failures might be coded here since
we're effectively still in the &quot;view&quot; layer per our definitions.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>my_app</strong></p><p>Under our methodology we make the greatest departures from typical Phoenix
development in this directory.  In typical Phoenix development practice this
directory is the home of the business/domain logic, the &quot;model&quot;.  For us,
however, this is our controller layer, but even more importantly it is where
we deal with the &quot;Definitional Concerns&quot; discussed earlier and which is unique
to <a href="MscmpSystForms.html#content"><code class="inline">MscmpSystForms</code></a> based forms.</p><h4>Sub-directories &amp; Files</h4><ul><li><p><code class="inline">msform</code></p><p>This directory holds source files and sub-directories for defining form
data, defining the abstract configuration of form components, and includes
our form controller logic which calls our externally defined business
logic in response to user interactions.</p><p>For each form, we define a single Elixir source file named after the name
of the form it exists to support.  We also create a sub-directory also
named after the form.</p></li><li><p><code class="inline">msform/my_form.ex</code></p><p>This Elixir source file defines a single module in the <code class="inline">Msform</code> namespace
which implements the <a href="MscmpSystForms.html#content"><code class="inline">MscmpSystForms</code></a> behavior (typically with
<code class="inline">use MscmpSystForms</code>).  This module also defines a struct of the form's
backing data using <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/3.10.3/Ecto.Schema.html#embedded_schema/1"><code class="inline">Ecto.Schema.embedded_schema/1</code></a> so that we can use the
fully data mapping and validation capability of both Ecto and Phoenix
forms.</p><p>Finally this module also defines an API for the form which includes the
implementation of the <a href="MscmpSystForms.html#content"><code class="inline">MscmpSystForms</code></a> Behaviour callbacks and functions
to expose other controller-like logic as appropriate to the forms specific
needs.  Note that the API is typically delegating to specific source files
and internal modules written in the <code class="inline">msform/my_form/*.ex</code> files.</p></li><li><p><code class="inline">msform/my_form/actions.ex</code></p><p>This source file typically defines a single module for the form
implementing the controller-like actions which are initiated from the
user interface or other sources the form should respond to (e.g. PubSub
messages).</p></li><li><p><code class="inline">msform/my_form/data.ex</code></p><p>Typically defines a single module containing functions which implement
form data validation via Changeset processing.</p></li><li><p><code class="inline">msform/my_form/definitions.ex</code></p><p>This file contains a single module directed at resolving a form's
&quot;Definitional Concerns&quot;.  In this module we find the implementation of the
<a href="#c:get_form_config/0"><code class="inline">MscmpSystForms.get_form_config/0</code></a> and
<a href="#c:get_form_modes/0"><code class="inline">MscmpSystForms.get_form_modes/0</code></a> functions.</p></li><li><p><code class="inline">msform/my_form/types.ex</code></p><p>A module to define/document form specific typespecs.  Usually this will
at least contain a type <code class="inline">parameters</code> for use in typespecs associated with
Changeset processing.  Since functions like <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/3.10.3/Ecto.Changeset.html#cast/4"><code class="inline">Ecto.Changeset.cast/4</code></a>
require their 'params' argument to be represented as a map and since we
know the possible valid structures of the map we can define a typespec to
help documenting that structure.</p></li></ul></li></ul>

<ul><li><p><code class="inline">msrd_instance_id</code> - the identifier for any single instance of a running
form.  This supports the use case where a user logged into a single session
may have multiple instances of the same form open accessing the same data,
but desiring to also edit that data.  In this case we only allow a single
instance of the form to be in an editable mode, blocking all other
instances, including other instances in the same session, from editing the
data.</p></li><li><p><code class="inline">msrd_session_name</code> - the identifier for the user's authenticated session.
This session name is a reference to the session record in the database which
contains session oriented data and session management statistics such as
expiration date/time.  It is by having a valid, authenticated session
identified by this value that the system knows that the user is
authenticated.</p></li><li><p><code class="inline">msrd_form_module</code> - the <a href="MscmpSystForms.html#content"><code class="inline">MscmpSystForms</code></a> behaviour implementing module
which backs the form.</p></li><li><p><code class="inline">msrd_original_data</code> - the data backing the form at the time the form was
initialized.  This data does not change as user interacts with the form,
including changing the form's data, allowing for comparisons, validations,
and resets of changed data with the starting data.  The original data is a
struct as defined by the <a href="MscmpSystForms.html#content"><code class="inline">MscmpSystForms</code></a> backing module where the keys are
the binding ID's of the form data fields.  Note that this data includes all
form backing data without regard to the current user's data visibility
permissions.</p></li><li><p><code class="inline">msrd_current_data</code> - the data backing the form including any changes
made by the user or by the system in response to various interactions with
the form.  As the name suggests this is value represents the current state
of the data and is the data that must pass any validation attempts and the
data that will ultimately be saved to the database.  This value is
represented as a simple map of key/value pairs where the keys are the
binding ID's of the form data fields. Note that this data includes all form
backing data without regard to the current user's data visibility
permissions.</p></li><li><p><code class="inline">msrd_display_data</code> - the data used to fill user interface form elements.
This data is the same as the <code class="inline">msrd_current_data</code> except that values which
are disallowed by the user data visibility permissions are excluded and the
data is represented as a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_html/3.3.2/Phoenix.HTML.Form.html#t:t/0"><code class="inline">Phoenix.HTML.Form.t/0</code></a> value.</p></li><li><p><code class="inline">msrd_feature</code> - the currently prevailing form state feature.  The
&quot;feature&quot; is the highest level determinant of form state, which determines
how some form user interface components present themselves or allow for
interactivity.  Typical examples of how the <code class="inline">msrd_feature</code> of a form might
be used includes a single form supporting both sales quoting and sales
ordering: while very similar there are differences in the functionality and
elements required by these two activities and the <code class="inline">msrd_feature</code> would tell
the form which mode was currently in use.  The value is an atom.  See
<a href="#c:get_form_modes/0"><code class="inline">MscmpSystForms.get_form_modes/0</code></a> for more information</p></li><li><p><code class="inline">msrd_mode</code> - the current mode of the form state.  This is typically used
to distinguish between &quot;view only&quot; form modes and &quot;maintenance&quot; form modes
which allow a user to change data.  The actual modes implemented by a form
are not restricted to these purposes and may be arbitrarily defined as the
form needs dictate. The current <code class="inline">msrd_mode</code> value is considered a
subdivision of the current <code class="inline">msrd_feature</code> value; this means that the same
<code class="inline">msrd_mode</code> value may appear to behave differently depending on the current
value of the <code class="inline">msrd_feature</code> attribute.  The value is an atom.  See
<a href="#c:get_form_modes/0"><code class="inline">MscmpSystForms.get_form_modes/0</code></a> for more information</p></li><li><p><code class="inline">msrd_state</code> - the current form state within the <code class="inline">msrd_mode</code>.  &quot;Form
states&quot; are the most granular level at which form user interface behaviors
are determined.  This value supports functionality which allows for
&quot;progressive entry&quot; style forms: forms which only allow certain user inputs
to be made prior to allowing others which depend on the earlier values, for
example.  <code class="inline">msrd_state</code> values are subordinate to the prevailing <code class="inline">msrd_mode</code>
value and as such the same <code class="inline">msrd_state</code> value may exhibit different
behaviors for differing values of <code class="inline">msrd_mode</code>.  The value is an atom.  See
<a href="#c:get_form_modes/0"><code class="inline">MscmpSystForms.get_form_modes/0</code></a> for more information</p></li><li><p><code class="inline">msrd_overrides</code> - a list of the currently active processing overrides.
As a user interacts with a form, there may be certain actions which result
in longer running processes during which certain user interface interactions
or data displays should become inactive or indicate some form of &quot;please
wait&quot; message; the list of active processing overrides indicate that such
processing exists so that user interface elements may respond as necessary.
This list is maintained using the
<a href="#start_processing_override/2"><code class="inline">MscmpSystForms.start_processing_override/2</code></a> and
<a href="#finish_processing_override/2"><code class="inline">MscmpSystForms.finish_processing_override/2</code></a> functions.</p></li><li><p><code class="inline">msrd_user_perms</code> - The relevant permission grants of the current user.
This is a map conforming to the <code class="inline">t:MscmpSystPerms.perm_grants/0</code> type.  The
permission grants are used as a filter for determining what the user may see
in terms of data and do in terms of form functionality.</p></li></ul><h2 id="init_assigns/8-parameters" class="section-heading">

the user interacting with the form.  All data backing the form is kept in
this value without regard to the current user's data visibility
permissions.  The expected value for this option is the starting data as a

    Parameters
  </a>
</h2>
<ul><li><p><code class="inline">socket_or_assigns</code> - the socket or assigns for the current view.</p></li><li><p><code class="inline">display_data</code> - this option contains either the new display data to set
and with which to update the form or indicates the kind of data validation
to perform on the assigns stored data (<code class="inline">msrd_original_data</code> &amp;
<code class="inline">msrd_current_data</code>; see <a href="#init_assigns/8"><code class="inline">MscmpSystForms.init_assigns/8</code></a> for more).</p><p>  One method for setting the display data is to pass this option to the
  function using actual data.  This data can take the form of either a
  <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/3.10.3/Ecto.Changeset.html#t:t/0"><code class="inline">Ecto.Changeset.t/0</code></a> value or a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_html/3.3.2/Phoenix.HTML.Form.html#t:t/0"><code class="inline">Phoenix.HTML.Form.t/0</code></a> value. If a
  Changeset is passed, the function will automatically process it into a
  <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_html/3.3.2/Phoenix.HTML.Form.html#t:t/0"><code class="inline">Phoenix.HTML.Form.t/0</code></a> struct, applying the permissions currently set
  in the <code class="inline">msrd_user_perms</code> Standard Assigns Attribute to filter the data.
  If the value to be passed in this option is a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_html/3.3.2/Phoenix.HTML.Form.html#t:t/0"><code class="inline">Phoenix.HTML.Form.t/0</code></a>
  value, the struct should have been generated using
  <a href="#to_form/3"><code class="inline">MscmpSystForms.to_form/3</code></a> so that the user data visibility permissions
  will have been allied.</p><p>  The second method is to pass <code class="inline">display_data</code> as a value referencing a
  display data validation type
  (<a href="MscmpSystForms.Types.html#t:data_validation_types/0"><code class="inline">MscmpSystForms.Types.data_validation_types/0</code></a>).  When this method is
  used, the values of the <code class="inline">msrd_current_data</code> and <code class="inline">msrd_original_data</code> are
  validated using the standard validation functions
  (<a href="#c:validate_save/2"><code class="inline">MscmpSystForms.validate_save/2</code></a> and
  <a href="#c:validate_post/2"><code class="inline">MscmpSystForms.validate_post/2</code></a>) and then processed into a
  <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_html/3.3.2/Phoenix.HTML.Form.html#t:t/0"><code class="inline">Phoenix.HTML.Form.t/0</code></a> value to save as the new <code class="inline">msrd_display_data</code>
  value.  Either of the validation types will result in the application of
  user data visibility permissions per the <code class="inline">msrd_user_perms</code> Standard
  Assigns Attribute.</p></li><li><p><code class="inline">opts</code> - this function defines some optionally required parameters
which are dependent on the <code class="inline">display_data</code> parameter. When the <code class="inline">display_data</code>
value is passed as a <a href="MscmpSystForms.Types.html#t:data_validation_types/0"><code class="inline">MscmpSystForms.Types.data_validation_types/0</code></a>
allowed value the following are required:</p><ul><li><p><code class="inline">original_data</code> - a struct of values representing the starting data
initialized on initial form loading and absent any changes the user
may have made and not yet committed to the database.  This value
should be available in the standard assigns for <a href="MscmpSystForms.html#content"><code class="inline">MscmpSystForms</code></a> based
forms.</p></li><li><p><code class="inline">current_data</code> - a map of values representing the current data
backing the form.  This data is complete (unfiltered by user data
related permissions) and includes any edits made by the user and not
yet committed to the database.  This value is available in the standard
assigns for <a href="MscmpSystForms.html#content"><code class="inline">MscmpSystForms</code></a> based forms.</p></li><li><p><code class="inline">module</code> - the name of the form module implementing the
<code class="inline">MscmpSystForm</code> behaviour and the functions to validate the Changeset.</p></li></ul></li></ul>

<p>Returns a list of <a href="MscmpSystForms.Types.FormConfig.html#t:t/0"><code class="inline">MscmpSystForms.Types.FormConfig.t/0</code></a> structs which
represent the abstract configuration of the form.</p><p>This function is usually simply returns a hard-coded list of
<a href="MscmpSystForms.Types.FormConfig.html#t:t/0"><code class="inline">MscmpSystForms.Types.FormConfig.t/0</code></a> values as defined
by the form developer.  This function is called by various form rendering
related functions to get the starting point for each component from which
<a href="MscmpSystForms.Types.ComponentConfig.html#t:t/0"><code class="inline">MscmpSystForms.Types.ComponentConfig.t/0</code></a> values will be created by
<a href="#get_render_configs/5"><code class="inline">MscmpSystForms.get_render_configs/5</code></a>.</p><p>Note that not all elements in a user interface require representation in the
form configuration returned by this function.  However, any element not
included in the form configuration here will be excluded from responding to
any changes in form state, processing overrides, or user permissions.</p><p>The configurations returned by this function, and the parent/child
relationships between individual <code class="inline">FormConfig</code> values, should be structured to
facilitate the appropriate inheritance of properties from <code class="inline">FormConfig</code> parent
to child; the goal being to reduce redundant establishment of those properties
in the configuration.  This will often times result in the data returned by
this function being hierarchical and resembling the layout structure of the
rendered form even though there is no requirement that the structure of these
configurations are related to the rendered layout in any way.</p><h2 id="c:get_form_config/0-examples" class="section-heading">

it's virtual because it defines no <code class="inline">form_id</code> value.  This top level value
exists so that its children can inherit its permission value and its defined
display modes (see <a href="#c:get_form_modes/0"><code class="inline">MscmpSystForms.get_form_modes/0</code></a>).</p><p>This doesn't mean that the returned configuration represents all elements in
the rendered form and the parent in this case, being virtual, doesn't
correspond to any rendered form element at all (that would require a <code class="inline">form_id</code>
value being defined).  The overall structure and the virtual element exist to
purely support the inheritance of configuration and state related values.</p><p>While with the structure in the example above, we can take advantage of
inherited values, we can selectively override those values as needed.

<p>An initialization sequence run during first, static mount process.</p><p>This callback is intended to define a function called in the first, static
<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/0.19.5/Phoenix.LiveView.html#c:mount/3"><code class="inline">Phoenix.LiveView.mount/3</code></a>.  While <a href="#c:preconnect_init/6"><code class="inline">preconnect_init/6</code></a> can encapsulate any
logic necessary during this phase of initialization, we would typically see
the following activities handled:</p><ul><li><p>The capture of socket values passed to <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/0.19.5/Phoenix.LiveView.html#c:mount/3"><code class="inline">Phoenix.LiveView.mount/3</code></a>,
such as <code class="inline">session_name</code> in preparation for calling <a href="#init_assigns/8"><code class="inline">init_assigns/8</code></a>.</p></li><li><p>The resolution of user permissions required by the form.</p></li><li><p>The loading of backing data from the database for the view or maintenance
of existing data, or defaulted data in the case of new record creation.</p></li><li><p>Initialization of the Standard Assign Attributes using <a href="#init_assigns/8"><code class="inline">init_assigns/8</code></a>.</p></li></ul><p>Naturally, while these would be typical activities to perform in
<a href="#c:preconnect_init/6"><code class="inline">preconnect_init/6</code></a>, they are not required not is this callback limited to
running these functions.  Truly, whatever makes sense for the form to process

<ul><li><p><code class="inline">socket_or_assigns</code> - the socket or assigns for the current view.</p></li><li><p><code class="inline">session_name</code> - the name of the session.  This value is usually set in
prior to the view being called and is part of the parameters passed to the
view.  Ultimately this is the link between the users client and our richer
sense of session available to the server side view logic.</p></li><li><p><code class="inline">feature</code> - the currently prevailing form state feature.  Typically this
value is passed to <a href="#init_assigns/8"><code class="inline">init_assigns/8</code></a> for further processing.</p></li><li><p><code class="inline">mode</code> - the currently prevailing form state mode.  Typically this value
is passed to <a href="#init_assigns/8"><code class="inline">init_assigns/8</code></a> for further processing.</p></li><li><p><code class="inline">state</code> - the currently prevailing form state.  Typically this value is

this callback is implemented for the form.  Since we often call
<a href="#init_assigns/8"><code class="inline">init_assigns/8</code></a> from <a href="#c:preconnect_init/6"><code class="inline">preconnect_init/6</code></a>, the options will simply be the

given set of data is sufficient for simply saving to the database.</p><p>In many cases in business applications, it is possible to save &quot;work in
progress&quot; to the database without needing to post a fully committed business
transaction.  For example, a purchase order may be authored over the course of
a few days before it is final and ready to send to the vendor; in this case
we could validate just enough data to make the in-progress purchase order
distinguishable from other similar orders while not requiring a fully
executable order and thus allow the author to save their work to the database.
Later, a transaction ready to be committed in the business sense (&quot;posting&quot;)
can call <a href="#c:validate_post/2"><code class="inline">validate_post/2</code></a> to validate that the transaction may be posted as
a valid business transaction.</p><p>Often times there is no distinction between the &quot;savable&quot; and &quot;postable&quot;
state.  In these cases, it's best to write the main validate logic in the
<a href="#c:validate_post/2"><code class="inline">validate_post/2</code></a> function and simply delegate this function to that one;
raising an exception in this function is also an option to force the correct
call.</p><h2 id="c:validate_save/2-parameters" class="section-heading">
