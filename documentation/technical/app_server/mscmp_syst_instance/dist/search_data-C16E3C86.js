A Datastore is the\ndatabase created to store the Instance's application data.  Datastore Contexts\nare the database roles with which the Instance will access the database; this\nallows for application database connections secured to an appropriate range\nof actions and limited to an appropriate number of concurrent database\nconnections.  Or to put it another way, Datastore Contexts can be thought of\nas \"Database Access Contexts\".\n\nDatastore and Datastore Context management is provided by the\n`MscmpSystDb` component.\n\n#### Owners\n\nOwners represent the known tenants of the system.  An Owner will own Instances\nof Applications.  Owners have states which determine if they are active, not\nactive, or even if they may be purged from the system.\n\n#### Applications\n\nEach Instance is an operational instance of a specific Application.  An\nApplication is simply what an end user would understand to be application:\ncomputer software which solves some problem for them better than could be\nsolved without such software.\n\nApplications in this component are added and maintained directly via database\nmigrations therefore there is no API provided to manage applications and there\nare no user maintainable Application attributes.\n\n#### Application Contexts\n\nApplication Context records define the expected Datastore Context records that\nmust be created for each Instance.  Each Application Context will be\nrepresent data ownership, data access restriction, and/or connection pool\nresource constraint.  When created Instances will have its own database roles\ncreated for each of the defined Application Contexts.\n\n#### Instance Types\n\nInstance Type records are used to define the default resource utilization\nclasses that are available for creating new Instances.  These defaults include\nsuch starting values as the number of database connections to use for each\nApplication Context and which server pools may host the Instance.\n\nAfter Instance creation, the Instance Type serves no further role for the\nInstance.\n\nNote that Instance Type records are a special case of the\n`Msdata.SystEnumItems` record.  The Enum Name for Instance Type\nis, unsurprisingly, `instance_types`.\n\n#### Instance Type Applications\n\nEstablishes that a given Instance Type will support a particular Application.\n\n#### Instance Type Contexts\n\nDefines defaults used in creating Instance Context records at Instance\ncreation time.\n\nWhen an association is made between an Instance Type and an Application via\na Instance Type Application association, a new Instance Type Context record is\ncreated for the combination of the Instance Type and each of the Application's\ndefined Application Contexts.\n\nAt Instance creation time, the Instance Type Context defaults are copied\ninto Instance specific Instance Context records to define the actual database\nroles which the instance will use to interact with the database.\n\nNote that Instance Type Context records are automatically created and\ndestroyed via the creation of Instance Type Application records by way of\ndatabase triggers; therefore the only application API related to these\nrecords is for updating them.\n\n#### Instances\n\nAn Instance represents the single environment of a specific Application and a\nspecific Owner.  Instance records are used to know which database server to\nconnect to, what Instance Context records are used for connecting to the\ndatabase, and the current state of the Instance including whether or not it's\nbeen updated with the Application database definition, is in a usable state,\nor can be purged from the system.\n\n#### Instance Contexts\n\nAn Instance's Instance Context records define specifically how an Instance\nwill connect to its Datastore including such information as how many\nconnections should be opened to the database.\n\nDatabase triggers are responsible for creating and destroying Instance Context\nrecords.  On creation, the Instance Context is created with default values\ndefined by Instance Type Context records for the type of Instance being\ncreated.
